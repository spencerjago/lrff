In this article, you will learn the basics of scraping and parsing data from
websites with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and
[Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).  You will then take this information and build
a sample application, first as a command line tool and then as a full
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web app.  Finally, you will  deploy your
new application on the [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) hosting platform.

There is a screencast that accompanies this article.  If you are interested in
