                For the uninitiated, Balkan Beat Box first burst out of New York City’s underground music scene in 2005, with a self-titled debut that introduced the world to their Mediterranean-inflected, globalized electronica sound.
For the uninitiated, Balkan Beat Box first burst out of New York City’s underground music scene in 2005, with a self-titled debut that introduced the world to their Mediterranean-...inflected, globalized electronica sound.<br><br>
Founded by Israeli-born ex-pats Ori Kaplan (ex-Gogol Bordello), Tamir Muskat (ex-Firewater), the band built their reputation on explosive live shows. BBB soon added frequent collaborator Tomer Yosef as frontman – his wild onstage energy galvanizing live audiences ever since.<br><br>

The three emerged as a cohesive songwriting trio on 2007’s Nu Med – Tamir crafting hard-edged beats, Ori orchestrating melodies and Tomer writing the hard-hitting lyrics – and took their sound to Belgrade and other points East on 2010’s Blue Eyed Black Boy.<br><br>

Inspired by last year’s people’s protest movements across the globe – from the Arab Spring, to Occupy Wall St., to Israel’s own massive social protests Balkan Beat Box's new album Give captures the cautious hope and re-energized spirit of our time.<br><br>

Brimming over with handcrafted beats and samples, and recorded primarily at Tel Aviv’s Vibromonk East studio, Give was conceived of as “a smaller, more introverted album,” according to Ori Kaplan. “It was fun for us to see what just came out of the three of us while we played with old analog synths and children’s toys”.<br><br>

“This is our most hardcore album so far,” says Tamir Muskat. “Definitely musically – there’s more of a harder-edged, electronic sound. The songs and their subjects are also kind of darker and more political.”<br><br>


One of the other animating forces on Give is fatherhood – all three members have become fathers since the recording of their last album, and Tomer explains how that influenced the band’s outlook: “When you have kids, you become a little more aware of what’s happening in the world and what kind of world that we’re leaving your kids. “<br><br>

“It was kind of a crazy vibe in the studio sometimes,” Tamir laughs. “We were recording some of our most hardcore songs ever, but our kids would be there, too, running around and playing in the middle of everything. I think it gave things a hopeful vibe, too… it reminds us that we’re fighting for something, not just against everything.”<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Mucca Pazza is the marching band that thinks it's a rock 'n roll band. The group is a collection of shameless band nerds wielding instruments of incongruous traditions, sometimes in competition, often in cooperation. Many of them played in traditional marching bands in high school. Others wanted to but couldn't because they played violin or accordion, and no one had yet come up with the amplified helmet. With speakers strapped firmly to heads, their rambunctious live show has brought them to such acclaimed venues as the Late Show with Conan O'Brien, Lollapalooza, and a fleet of canoes floating down the Chicago River.

Their music skips from genre to unnameable genre, never settling in one place for long, but held together by the band's unmistakable sound and irresistible energy. To their credit, they only have one march in their original repertoire, their other music includes zombie-mambo, snake-charmer-metal, gypsy-reggaeton, punk-classical, and some demented arrangements of Dmitri Shostakovich, Bela Bartok, and famed Egyptian composer Kemal El Tawil.

"Any band that can get a crowd of 700, the majority of which have never heard of them, dancing, pogoing, screaming and beaming in a span of 10 minutes definitely has a good thing going. Mucca Pazza managed to reach those and teh frat boys, the soccer moms, the cowboys, the gangstas, and everyone in between." --Arizona Daily Star<br /><br />

                "Dan Bejar started Destroyer as a solo project in Vancouver in 1995. His first album, We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge, was an electric folk record, setting the stage for the early Bowie comparisons that were certain to follow his particular vocal style. In 1998, Bejar added a rhythm section and took it into the studio for the first time. The resulting recording, City of Daughters, is a sparsely produced collection of catchy pop songs in which Bejar's increasingly obtuse lyrics really start to stand out. Thief, again recorded in Vancouver, was released in 2000, but by now the lineup had expanded into a quintet. The sparse production and the Bowie comparisons remained, but Bejar's cryptic lyrics and unique voice gave this rant against the music industry an original quality missing from many of that year's releases. The following year would see Destroyer's fourth album, Streethawk: A Seduction. Streethawk begins right where Thief leaves off. The production and the sound remain solid, but the lyrics have become even more obtuse. Stuck somewhere between literacy and nonsense, they must be considered poetry because any attempt to decipher meaning, however hidden, might drive the listener crazy. This Night was the next release, an oblique and melodic album that portrayed Bejar as a ranting, depressed singer.<br><br>
Destroyer has not been the only vehicle for Bejar's talents -- he is also one of the songwriters (along with Carl Newman of Zumpano) responsible for the much-acclaimed New Pornographers' Mass Romantic (Mint Records). This Night, which appeared in fall 2002, marked his first for Merge. His quirkiest material to date was captured on 2004's Your Blues. In 2005 Bejar collaborated with touring partners Frog Eyes on Notorious Lightning and Other Works, a six-track EP containing re-recorded versions of material from Your Blues with Frog Eyes as the backing band. In 2005 Bejar contributed three songs to the New Pornographers' critically acclaimed Twin Cinema and spent the better part of that year on tour with the Canadian supergroup. February 2006 saw the release of Destroyer's Rubies, a return to the guitar-based sound of This Night with a touch of Streethawk-era drama. After devoting some more time to the New Pornographers and Swan Lake, he returned to the sanctuary of his solo project, and released his eighth record, Trouble in Dreams, in March of 2008. The following year saw the release of Swan Lake's second outing, Enemy Mine, as well as the ambient Bay of Pigs EP (Destroyer). He contributed three tracks to the New Pornographers' fifth studio album, 2010’s Together, before releasing 2011’s Kaputt, his ninth LP under the Destroyer moniker." - Terrance Miles, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Sandro Perri is a songwriter and producer of new music. Within the broad spectrum of his work are elements of pop, folk, electronic, dance, jazz, noise and rock. His latest LP, Impossible Spaces, experiments with new song and production beyond any of his previous efforts to date.  Dusted Magazine suggested that "Perri spins anti-matter and intangibles into something undeniably real."

Since 1999, he has released more than a dozen solo and collaborative records under his given name as well as Polmo Polpo, Glissandro 70, Dot Wiggin and Continuous Dick. He founded a 12? label (Audi Sensa) for his early releases but has since worked almost exclusively with Constellation (home of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, A Silver Mt. Zion, Colin Stetson and Do Make Say Think.)

His early music, as Polmo Polpo, explored dance music at it's fringes; slowed-down techno, crumbling rhythm and white noise provided a shifting bed of sound for lap steel guitar and cello. It was during this period that Perri developed an approach to creating musical hybrids through production and composition. Most of this music, originally only available on 12?, was compiled on CD in 2002 as The Science Of Breath. In 2003, he recorded a 28-minute cover of Arthur Russell's 1978 classic Kiss Me Again, forging a mellow but monstrous new blend of disco and drone. It was edited down and released in 2005, with blessings by Russell's original co-producer, legendary DJ Nicky Siano.

Also in 2003, Constellation released Like Hearts Swelling, Perri's full-length debut as Polmo Polpo. 5 long tracks of looped strings, guitar, percussion and heavy electronics combined to create an epic and meditative record of "perfectly structured, unstructured sound" (Pitchfork). Like Hearts Swelling was met with critical praise worldwide and an invitation to perform at London's ATP Festival in 2004. 

In 2004, Perri stepped beyond loops and reshaped his music for live musicians. He started work on group arrangements and pursued songwriting (and singing) as a new challenge. He recorded an EP of vocal-based songs in 2006, Sandro Perri Plays Polmo Polpo. Proposed as a re-imagining of instrumentals from Like Hearts Swelling, it was referred to as "…like his earlier music coming apart at the seams." (Dusted)

He further refined this approach on 2007's Tiny Mirrors, an LP of liquid folk songs performed with some of Toronto's freest improvisers. Striking "a perfect balance of sophisticated writing and deceptively effortless performance," Tiny Mirrors signaled a significant breakthrough for Perri as a songwriter. It was met with critical acclaim; long-listed for Canada's Polaris Prize, nominated for SOCAN's Echo Songwriting award ("Double Suicide") and named the #1 record of 2007 by acclaimed music writer Carl Wilson. 

Throughout this period, Perri continued to explore dance music (the one-off Continuous Dick 12" in 2005) and joined forces with guitarist Craig Dunsmuir to form Glissandro 70. Together they shaped Dunsmuir's solo guitar music into a s/t debut for Constellation in 2006. Threading looped guitars around odd-time rhythms and chants, they melded elements of early dance, math rock, juju and noisy electronics into a record of striking originality. Their infectious "Bolan Muppets" earned a spot on Prins Thomas' Cosmo Galactic Prism mix while music critic Philip Sherburne tweeted "I feel like Glissandro 70 invented 2011 in 2007."

Other past and present collaborators include Great Lake Swimmers, Eric Chenaux, Ryan Driver, Fond Of Tigers, Andre Ethier, Lorenz Peter, Mantler, Zongamin, Mickey Moonlight and Drew Brown. In 2010, Perri collaborated with John K Samson, Christine Fellows and filmmaker Daniel Cockburn for Canada's historic National Parks Project.

Increasingly active in studio and production work, he has also provided various levels of assistance as producer, tracking, mix, remix and mastering engineer to artists including Owen Pallett (w/Grizzly Bear), Stephen Malkmus, The Acorn, Deep Dark United, Woodpigeon, Devon Sproule and many more.

Touring internationally since 2003, Perri has appeared at numerous festivals including ATP, Domino, Nuit Blanche (playing Erik Satie's Vexations for solo piano), MUTEK, Wordless Music Series, MOMA PS/1 Warmup, Maxximalism, Suoni Per Il Popolo, Tanned Tin, Heartland, Send+Receive, X-Avant and Sappyfest.

He received composition and recording grants from the Toronto Arts Council and Ontario Arts Council in 2005, 2006 and 2010.<br /><br />

                Theophilus London is an alternative rap artist from Brooklyn, NY, whose genre-bending approach draws from a range of styles, from soul-pop and post-punk to electro and contemporary R&B. Citing influences that include Michael Jackson and Prince as well as Kraftwerk and the Smiths, he began working with the New York City-based label Normrex in 2007. He made his label debut with a couple mixtapes, Jam! (2008) and This Charming Mixtape (2009), which circulated freely in the music blogopshere. London made his album debut in 2009 with This Charming Man, a stylistically wide-ranging full-length effort featuring an eclectic cast of vocal guests and production work by Normrex beatmakers Machinedrum, Jimmy Edgar, and Letherette.<br /><br />

                Hello dear, dear person,<br><br>
Do you think that the "Rock Band Of The Year" should be a band that actually plays rock music?<br><br>
T<br><br>
Do you miss the sound of cheap guitar amps being captured by expensive microphones?<br><br>
H<br><br>
Do you want goosebumps from hearing 5 single-minded men with a telepathic connection slamming their instruments against each other and the floor?<br><br>
E<br><br>
Have you been to a concert by the latest saviours of music and been thoroughly underwhelmed by the performance and showmanship?<br><br>
H<br><br>
Are you interested in music built out of blood, guts and will-power, and not ones and zeros?<br><br>
I<br><br>
Does this make you think of The Hives?<br><br>
V<br><br>
Are you wondering what they have been up to the last couple of years?<br><br>
E<br><br>
By all means, read on...<br><br>
S<br><br>
Do you hear a swooping sound? Can you feel warm gusts of wind against your face? It is the phoenix rising from the ashes, and while one arm flaps vigorously, beneath the other he is holding a golden disc. He is coming closer... The disc says... LEX HIVES!!!<br><br>
Yes, little reader, the world's wisest musical council and international rock sensation, The Hives, are back! On June 5th, Howlin' Pelle Almqvist, Nicholaus Arson, Chris Dangerous, Dr. Matt Destruction, and Vigilante Carlstroem will return with their fifth stunner -- the 12-track contemplation of all law that is Hives - - Lex Hives. The term "Lex Hives" is a phrase derived from the ancient Roman practice of enacting a system or body of laws and accepting them as a standard. Thus, the 12 songs on Lex Hives make up the holy laws after which all life from now on must be lived.<br><br>
Chiselled into the melted wax cake 33 1/3 long-player, Lex Hives will be released on The Hives' own label Disques Hives. Self-produced, self-played, self- released, and self-promoted, these 12 songs are not built to fit just anyone. These are not songs that sound equally good played on an acoustic guitar by the campfire. This is not music. This is compressed carbon hidden in the earth's crust for millions of years and unearthed, to be placed in your eardrums.
–– Lex Hives took a year and a half of thinking and 3 months of recording. –– Lex Hives is slightly over 30 minutes long. This is not short. If recorded by some other band it would have been 45 minutes. –– Lex Hives has exactly the contractually specified 12 songs.<br><br>
–– Lex Hives has a booklet for the first time depicting the workstation at Hive Manor.<br><br>
–– Lex Hives was mixed by Grammy Award winner Andrew Scheps, Dave Sardy and Joe Zook, because only the best will do and California is nicer than Sweden in February.
Born almost two decades ago in 1993 in Fagersta, Sweden, The Hives have long been a rock 'n’ roll force to be reckoned with. Their debut, 1997’s Barely Legal, shot thru the punk community like a runaway locomotive, with faster-than-fast blistering punk that had the punks cheering and raising bottles and cans, but left most of the mainstream going, "Oh... well... uhm what?". With 2000’s more studio-wise Veni Vidi Vicious, and the UK smash Your New Favourite Band (a compilation of songs from Barely Legal, VVV and the A.k.a I-D-I-O-T EP), however, The Hives wrote the book on the decade’s garage-rock success together with the likes of Detroit's The White Stripes to name but one of many.
Your New Favourite Band even went not silver, gold or even multi-platinum, but diamond, thanks to the hits ‘Hate To Say I Told You So’, ‘Main Offender’, ‘Supply And Demand’ and ‘Die, Alright!’ These songs blew people’s brains out and the boys in black and white got their first taste of radio and music television airplay.<br><br>
The world had crumbled and now greeted The Hives with open arms, endearing letters and red carpets, while hymns and children were produced in their honour. This black-and-white phenomenon toured constantly for three years and no-one wanted it to end, but the boys had decided to record again as they could not let go of the idea of reinventing not only rock 'n’ roll but also themselves.
Their third and – as the band had decided in their early teens with the black-and- white logic (no pun intended) of zealous youths – last record – as no band to their knowledge had ever made more than 3 good records in a row – 2004’s Tyrannosaurus Hives, successfully patted down the earth around the flag they’d placed atop this measly globe. With further hits like the unstoppable ‘Walk Idiot Walk’, ‘Two-Timing Touch & Broken Bones’ and ‘A Little More For Little You’, they once again repeated the cycle – "release new Hives record, conquer world by touring, repeat". And, God knows, like marauding vikings with much better dress sense, they conquered!<br><br>
With 2007's mindblower The Black and White Album, on which they messed with the ‘Hives voice’ by for the first time entertaining the notion of outside influence, in the shape of music producers such as Pharrell Williams, Jacknife Lee and Dennis Herring, The Hives landed a fish so big not even Mother Earth could swallow it. The second big bang was a fact, and that, folks, was exactly what the first single/hit song from the album stated – ‘Tick Tick Boom!’ Once again the success cycle was repeated, and after the 400 gigs and 25 nights in hospitals that followed that record, The Hives again felt that three years on the road was sufficient. Even if they did manage to extend their live universe with visits to previously uncharted South American lands like Chile, Argentina and Brazil, they decided it was time to hit the studio again. It was time for the Big Kahuna, the Colossus of Rhodes, the greatest wonder the world had ever seen! It was time to present the laws of The Hives. It was time to write –– Lex Hives!!!<br><br>
Perhaps having acquired a taste for working with big-shot producers on The B&W Album, they this time decided to track down the five biggest names in popular music for the job. The names that came up? Howlin’ Pelle Almqvist, Nicholaus Arson, Chris Dangerous, Dr. Matt Destruction, and Vigilante Carlstroem. The five members of The Hives knew that in order to make the boat rock, one needed the ones who'll rock the boat (simple Hives logic). Said and done, The Hives curled up in their patented fetal studio position and in the next two years hunkered in the rock & roll laboratory – various laboratories, in fact, including Atlantis, RMV and Decibel in Stockholm, and legendary Hansa in Berlin – and meticulously built what now is named Lex Hives!<br><br>
Blistering proof of the band’s quest can be found with the lead single, ‘Go Right Ahead’, gives us The Hives moving into glam-punk territory, and is the first Hives recording, together with its Lex Hives album mate ‘Midnight Shifter’, ever to feature brass. Emerging from the glam sax-laden overdub jungle like the winners they are, The Hives come out swinging their machete guitars with a track that leaves no-one clueless as to what the message is –– "PARTY like there is no tomorrow, you crazy fucks!”<br><br>
As Lex Hives sails hot off the press along the Disques Hives conveyer belt, The Hives themselves are once more ecstatic to be alive and set free again and are readier than ready to return to the world stages – beginning with an appearance at this year's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (Weekend One: April 13th-15th / Weekend Two: April 20th-22nd). On Monday, April 23rd the band will make their return live appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live outdoor stage (ABC 12am/11pm Central).<br><br>
In special celebration of the world's new favourite holiday, Record Store Day, the band will release the limited edition 7-inch single for ‘Go Right Ahead’ that features the unreleased track ‘1000 Answers’ on Saturday, April 21st, 2012. Fast forward to June 5th – Lex Hives Day, remember? – and a deluxe edition will feature bonus tracks recorded and produced by Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme.
Louder. Bolder. Prouder. More convinced than ever. The Hives are finally out of the dark ages and steering toward the light.<br><br>
This is THE LAW. The Law that is Hives. LEX HIVES! The laws of nature are pale in comparison and The Hives demand nothing but complete obedience.<br /><br />

                FIDLAR are slackers at heart. The only thing they really care about is skateboarding; trivial things like doing their homework and making the grade in school have little meaning to them. But when their adopted Vietnamese brother turns up dead after discovering an error in the shipping records at his place of work, FIDLAR begins to suspect something more. Refusing to accept the police's theory of suicide, FIDLAR launches their own investigation, determined to uncover the truth of what really happened to their brother.<br /><br />

                "Issaquah, WA, indie rock trio Modest Mouse was formed in 1993 by vocalist/guitarist Isaac Brock, bassist Eric Judy, and drummer Jeremiah Green. After honing their muscular sound in "The Shed" -- a makeshift practice space built by Brock on the land next to his mother's trailer -- Modest Mouse entered Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios to cut their 1994 self-titled debut single, released on Johnson's K Records label. Following a move to the Up label, the trio issued two 1996 LPs, This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About and Interstate 8. After returning to K, Modest Mouse released The Fruit That Ate Itself in 1997; its follow-up from later that year, The Lonesome Crowded West, was the band's breakthrough, and in the wake of a major-label bidding war, they signed to Sony. The rarities collection Building Nothing out of Something appeared on Up in early 2000, followed later that year by their long-awaited Epic debut, The Moon & Antarctica. In 2001, the band issued the Everywhere and His Nasty Parlor Tricks EP and K released Sad Sappy Sucker, a "lost album" that was intended to be the group's full-length debut back in 1994. Brock kept busy with his Ugly Casanova side project, which delivered Sharpen Your Teeth in 2002. Modest Mouse finally returned in 2004 with Good News for People Who Love Bad News, their best-received record and a Top 40 hit as well. For their next record, Brock enlisted the help of former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, who not only added his songwriting and playing skills to We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank -- which was released in early 2007 -- but also toured with the band as a member. No One's First and You're Next, an odds and sods collection of songs that included material dating back to the Good News for People Who Love Bad News era, arrived in summer 2009." - Jason Ankeny, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                Speakers everywhere this fall will rejoice with the arrival of Eyes at Half Mast, the third record from Talkdemonic. The Portland, Oregon duo of Kevin O'Connor and Lisa Molinaro have been playing together since 2003; she plays the viola and cello, while he plays everything else, including, but not limited to: drums, synths, and acoustic instruments. The result is an intoxicating blend of symphonic strings and explosive percussion; achingly beautiful music.

Eyes at Half Mast is the band's high water mark. The album teems with moments of spirited beauty, (especially on Duality of Deathening and March Movement) and of haunting elegies (as exemplified by Tides in Their Grave and Dust and Heat). There are passages filled with raw dissonance on the record, such as the release and tension offered by Civilian. There is a sense of loss and memory running through many of these songs, but the tone of the record is ultimately one of hope, a satisfyingly dark vitality that embraces melodic confidence.

Talkdemonic continue to expand the range of emotion that they are able to evoke without words. The band is emerging in terms of composition, song structure and recording, and the sound crystallizes here. Talkdemonic hit a stride in songwriting with tunes like Ending the Orange Glow and Black Wood Crimson, which feature complex arrangements, layers and harmonies. It's worth nor mixed thirteen of the fourteen songs from this set.

Audiences admire Talkdemonic for their uncompromisingly cathartic and bewitching live sets, as they witness the co-mingling of O'Connor's rhythmic prowess and Molinaro's tempestuous craft. It becomes a welcome contagion, to know Talkdemonic, as they remind us continue to treat music as something of crucial importance and endless amazement.<br /><br />

                "Issaquah, WA, indie rock trio Modest Mouse was formed in 1993 by vocalist/guitarist Isaac Brock, bassist Eric Judy, and drummer Jeremiah Green. After honing their muscular sound in "The Shed" -- a makeshift practice space built by Brock on the land next to his mother's trailer -- Modest Mouse entered Calvin Johnson's Dub Narcotic Studios to cut their 1994 self-titled debut single, released on Johnson's K Records label. Following a move to the Up label, the trio issued two 1996 LPs, This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About and Interstate 8. After returning to K, Modest Mouse released The Fruit That Ate Itself in 1997; its follow-up from later that year, The Lonesome Crowded West, was the band's breakthrough, and in the wake of a major-label bidding war, they signed to Sony. The rarities collection Building Nothing out of Something appeared on Up in early 2000, followed later that year by their long-awaited Epic debut, The Moon & Antarctica. In 2001, the band issued the Everywhere and His Nasty Parlor Tricks EP and K released Sad Sappy Sucker, a "lost album" that was intended to be the group's full-length debut back in 1994. Brock kept busy with his Ugly Casanova side project, which delivered Sharpen Your Teeth in 2002. Modest Mouse finally returned in 2004 with Good News for People Who Love Bad News, their best-received record and a Top 40 hit as well. For their next record, Brock enlisted the help of former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, who not only added his songwriting and playing skills to We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank -- which was released in early 2007 -- but also toured with the band as a member. No One's First and You're Next, an odds and sods collection of songs that included material dating back to the Good News for People Who Love Bad News era, arrived in summer 2009." - Jason Ankeny, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Speakers everywhere this fall will rejoice with the arrival of Eyes at Half Mast, the third record from Talkdemonic. The Portland, Oregon duo of Kevin O'Connor and Lisa Molinaro have been playing together since 2003; she plays the viola and cello, while he plays everything else, including, but not limited to: drums, synths, and acoustic instruments. The result is an intoxicating blend of symphonic strings and explosive percussion; achingly beautiful music.

Eyes at Half Mast is the band's high water mark. The album teems with moments of spirited beauty, (especially on Duality of Deathening and March Movement) and of haunting elegies (as exemplified by Tides in Their Grave and Dust and Heat). There are passages filled with raw dissonance on the record, such as the release and tension offered by Civilian. There is a sense of loss and memory running through many of these songs, but the tone of the record is ultimately one of hope, a satisfyingly dark vitality that embraces melodic confidence.

Talkdemonic continue to expand the range of emotion that they are able to evoke without words. The band is emerging in terms of composition, song structure and recording, and the sound crystallizes here. Talkdemonic hit a stride in songwriting with tunes like Ending the Orange Glow and Black Wood Crimson, which feature complex arrangements, layers and harmonies. It's worth nor mixed thirteen of the fourteen songs from this set.

Audiences admire Talkdemonic for their uncompromisingly cathartic and bewitching live sets, as they witness the co-mingling of O'Connor's rhythmic prowess and Molinaro's tempestuous craft. It becomes a welcome contagion, to know Talkdemonic, as they remind us continue to treat music as something of crucial importance and endless amazement.<br /><br />

                An ultimate Michael Jackson Tribute band needs glitzy jackets, glittery gloves and 80’s regalia. It must pay studious attention to the intricate details of every original groove and gravity-defying dance step. It must demonstrate a commitment to the unforgettable musical legacy the King of Pop left us. Beyond replaying MJ’s countless hits, an ultimate Michael Jackson tribute band must possess the ...ability to connect millions of people around the globe with each resurrection of our favorite Michael Jackson songs.<br><br>
In January of 2004, Who’s Bad mesmerized a standing-room only gathering of friends and pop music lovers at a small nightclub in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They have since played over 700 shows in numerous countries and now boast the title, “The Ultimate Michael Jackson Tribute Band.” Their live performance is a jaw-dropping musical extravaganza that pulls from 3 ½ hours of Michael Jackson’s catalogue and spans four decades of Michael Jackson’s extraordinary music career.<br><br>
From ABC to You Rock My World, no song is forgotten in this electrifying revival of Pop Music's Royal Highness. As the longest running MJ tribute band and the only one that predates his passing, Who’s Bad has awed Michael Jackson fans at sold-out shows the world over. Who’s Bad has packed internationally-acclaimed pavilions numerous times, including The House of Blues in Houston, Dallas, and New Orleans; Washington D.C.’s 930 Club, and the River Rock Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia. Their first tour of China included sold-out stops at Ningbo’s Grand Theatre, Wutaishan Stadium in Nanjing, People’s Grand Hall in Chongqing, Red Stadium in Chengdu, and Hunan Grand Theatre in Chengsha. Who’s Bad also gained the respect and admiration of thousands of MJ fans in the United Kingdom with performances at Royal and Derngate in Northampton, Central Theatre in Chatham, Embassy Theatre in Skegness, The Orchard Theatre in Dartford, The Palace Theater in Manchester and The Pavilion in Glasgow. With sold-out shows from Colorado’s Bluebird Theatre to Romania’s Sala Palatalui and anticipated tour dates in Central and South America, no corner of the globe is safe from this infectious party production.<br><br>
Founded in 2004 by saxophonist, composer and arranger Vamsi Tadepalli and spearheaded by some of North Carolina's premiere musicians, Who's Bad has crafted an intricate performance complete with synchronized dance routines, blaring horn section and down-deep rhythms--each delivered with a precision that could only be superseded by the King himself. They’ve shared the stage with some of pop music’s biggest acts including The Four Tops, Boys II Men, and The Backstreet Boys. Captivated fans include LIVENATION’s Anthony Nicolaidis who calls Who’s Bad, “the real deal,” and Michael Jackson’s longtime friend and manager Frank DiLeo, who, after catching Who’s Bad’s concert in Nashville, TN said, “The show was great… Michael would have been proud!” Such accolades have earned Who’s Bad an invitation to play London’s O2 in December of 2010, the venue where the King of Pop was slated to end his career with a 50-show “This Is It” concert series before meeting his untimely demise.<br><br>
Whether you idolized the Jackson 5, fell in love to Human Nature or memorized all of Thriller's creepy choreography, Who’s Bad is authentic, music-driven, must-see entertainment that navigates you back to that special place. As the curtain opens on a Who’s Bad performance, even the most skeptical Michael Jackson fan feels the excitement rising, screams at the sight of that unmistakable silhouette, and succumbs to a surefire MJ sing-along. The energy is magnetic, the musicianship is first-class, the dance moves exhilarating. Who’s Bad is a homage befitting a King and their high octane execution of MJ hits has exclusively catapulted them to the ranks of ultimate!<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Three Legged Fox released Always Anyway in summer of 2011.  Since then they have committed to bringing their live show and message to every city in the United States, including a current nine week Spring/Summer tour.  An informal entry into national touring has afforded the band the opportunity to travel and play in many places they thus far have never been.  Always Anyway marked a couple milestones for the band including a #2 chart spot on iTunes Reggae, and is the band's bestselling album to date.  More importantly is the ability to play 150-200 shows this year.  "We've gotten email, or fan mail…whatever you want to call it, from people for years from so many different places that we couldn't get ourselves to.  And so to have the chance to do that now is really a blessing.  Music is fan driven, it has to be.  The fans that we have, their support and loyalty is never lost on us.  We appreciate it tremendously," explains drummer Kory Kochersperger.<br /><br />

                Bach To Rock is the Music School for students of all ages. B2R’s unique method is based on the knowledge that students learn best when they join together to play the music they like the most. That’s why we use special arrangements of the music of our time and combine individual lessons with band instruction. Weekly “jam sessions” lead to Battles of the Bands and recording sessions in B2R Studios, our own professional recording facilities. B2R also holds regularly scheduled public concerts that encourage students to become seasoned performers. These creative group activities foster teamwork, build self-esteem and motivate students to perfect their musicianship through independent practice.<br /><br />

                Each US Regional competition will consist of two rounds. In Round 1, each competitor performs to a song of their own choosing. In Round 2, the top competitors from Round 1 perform to a surprise compulsory song. In each round, contestants perform for one minute of a song and are judged on a combination of technical merit, stage presence, and “airness." All guitars must be invisible. In each city, the jury is a panel of independent judges that are hand picked by US Air Guitar. The results of the jury cannot be protested.<br><br>
One winner from each city will be flown to a-yet-to-be-disclosed city in early August to compete in the US Air Guitar Finals for the crown of US Air Guitar Champion. The 2012 US Champ will then be sent to Oulu, Finland later that month to represent the USA in the World Championships, where he or she will compete against national champions from all around the world.<br><br>
Founded in 2003, US Air Guitar is the official Air Guitar Association of the United States and is responsible for operating the US Air Guitar Championships, official Regional events, and specialized championships. US Air Guitar is devoted to taking our nation's unofficial pastime out of the bedroom and putting it up on the world stage. US Air Guitar is an official member of the World Air Guitar Association. Entering its seventh year in the US and its fourteenth year world-wide, official national championships currently are held in 24 countries around the globe including the USA, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, South Africa, , with more countries participating every year.<br /><br />

                Reel Big Fish was one of the legions of Southern California ska-punk bands to edge into the mainstream following the mid-’90s success of No Doubt and Sublime. Like most of their peers, the band was distinguished by their hyperkinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997, when their single “Sell Out” became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Their appearance in the movie “Baseketball” as the halftime band also gained them more fans and helped the bands popularity to grow. Still fronted by original lead singer and song writer Aaron Barrett, they continue releasing albums and touring relentlessly, playing more and more countries and  bigger venues all over the world.<br><br>

Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, “Everything Sucks”, in 1995. “Everything Sucks” became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label’s president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced “Turn the Radio Off”, which marked Reel Big Fish’s first album for Mojo. “Turn the Radio Off” was unleashed in August 1996, and over the next year, the group continually toured in support of the album’s release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single “Sell Out” began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song’s quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100.<br><br>

In 1998 the song “Take on Me” from the “Baseketball” motion picture soundtrack was released as the promotional single for the movie and once again found the band in regular rotation on rock radio and MTV in the USA.<br><br>

The Album “Why Do They Rock So Hard” followed a year later, once again enlisting Oingo Boingo Bassist John Avila as producer. The album was not as commercially successful but is still regarded by many fans as the bands finest work. The band filmed a music video for “the Set up (You Need This)”, the only single released from this album.

The guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive’s parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish’s first release for Jive, a more rock-oriented record entitled “Cheer Up!”, appeared in mid-2002. This album was very successful in Europe with the video for the single “Where Have You Been”  receiving heavy airplay on many music video channels.<br><br>

The band’s next album, the cynical yet catchy “We’re Not Happy ‘Til You’re Not Happy”, was issued in April 2005. Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since the “Cheer Up!” release.<br><br>

In August 2006, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled “Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album”. A few months later — and much to the annoyance of the band — Jive issued its own Reel Big Fish album, a best-of compilation entitled “Greatest Hit…and More”. Reel Big Fish received no money from the album’s sales, as Jive Records now owned the rights to the bulk of their songs.  The band has urged fans not to buy this album because it was not approved by them and the sound quality is inferior.<br><br>

Nevertheless, the band returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP “Duet All Night Long” with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. “Monkeys for Nothin’ and the Chimps for Free” followed several months later, marking Reel Big Fish’s first full-length studio release since leaving Jive’s roster, and 2009?s “Fame, Fortune and Fornication” found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, the Eagles, and Tom Petty.<br><br>

The band’s latest release is called “A Best of Us for the Rest of Us”. It includes a 22 song disc of re-recorded hits and classic fan favorites as well as a bonus disc of 14 Acoustic or “SKAcoustic” versions.<br><br>

Reel Big Fish continues to tour non-stop, playing over 250 shows a year to thousands of loyal fans all over the world, gaining more and more underground popularity as the Ska scene continues to flourish.<br /><br />

                Goldfinger formed with it's original line-up in 1994. John and Simon worked together at NaNa's shoe store in California. They decided to form a band and needed a drummer, so they asked Darrin who was working at the local Starbucks to listen to a tape they had made. The day he heard it he was air drumming along with it all day, he loved it! At this time, Goldfinger's original guitarist left to the ...band to become a pro surfer in Costa Rica, where he still lives. John had a good friend named Charlie who played guitar and he thought he would be a great replacement on guitar.<br><br>

Charlie's first show with Goldfinger was a little hectic, he was given a tape of the songs on Friday night, practiced with the band on Saturday and played a show that night. Goldfinger were now recording their Demo EP called "richter", it was given amazing reviews and they were getting good indie/college radio airplay. Goldfinger were now given the oppurtunity to record the S/T debut LP. They recorded the cd in 1995 and it was released in spring on 1996, their first single/video "Here in your Bedroom" was played at a high rate and they gained in popularity. Goldfinger also released videos for "Mable" and "Only a Day".<br><br>

In 1996 Goldfinger played more shows than there are days...they toured with such bands as the Sex Pistols, No Doubt, Vans Warped Tour, and Reel Big Fish. In 1997 Goldfinger released their second LP entitled "Hang-Up's" their first single "This Lonely Place" was not as big a success as the release of "Here in your Bedroom", but it did give them numerous live talk show apperances and spins of the video, which is a play on "Alien". Goldfinger also released a video for the single "More Today than Yesterday" a cover of the Spiral Staircase song. Which can be found on the "Waterboy" soundtrack.<br><br>

In the summer of 1998, Simon left the band due to musical differences. He was replaced by John's old band mate from the Electric Love Hogs. And more recently the bassist for 22jacks a band that opened for Goldfinger on many tours. Goldfinger Released their second EP in the Fall on '99 Called. "Darrin's Coconut Ass-Live From Omaha" The EP contains 8 songs which are all covers. In the Spring on 2000 Goldfinger released their 3rd LP called "Stomping Ground" the single in North America was "Counting the Days" while Europe was invaded with "99 Red Balloons". The band has been touring since the release of Stomping Ground with such bands as: Eve6, Showoff, BloodHound Gang, and Mest.<br><br>

In 2002 Charlie left the band and was replaced by Brian Arthur, formerly of Unloco. Brian joined the band just before the released of their 2003 cd called "Open Your Eyes" which was released on Jive/Zoomba. The band toured in support with large acts like Sum41 and Good Charlotte. The band toured on and off until 2005 when they released "Disconnection Notice" on Maverick Records and toured Europe, Australia, and North America in support. In mid-2005 the band released Brian Arthur of duties on guitar and replaced him with ex-guitarist Charlie Paulson. Since Charlies' return the band has been playing a handful of shows and done a few small tours. In 2007 Goldfinger finished the recording of their next cd which was released in 2008 on Sideone Dummy called "Hello Destiny". To promote the album, the band embarked on a successful North American tour with Less Than Jake in summer of 2008. They also played in the UK at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 22–23 August 2008.<br><br>

Recently, frontman John Feldmann has produced records for Mest, The Used (whose vocalist Bert McCracken sang some guest vocals on "Open Your Eyes", "Woodchuck", "Ocean Size", and "Handjobs for Jesus"), Hilary Duff and Story of the Year. He also produced Good Charlotte's single "The Anthem" (whose guitarist Benji Madden provides guest vocals on "January".<br><br>

"99 Red Balloons" is featured in Not Another Teen Movie, Eurotrip, the video game Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, and along with their cover of The Spiral Starecase's "More Today Than Yesterday", during the ending credits of The Waterboy . "Superman" is featured in the comedy Kingpin. "Walking in the Dark" is featured in the movie Dead Man on Campus.<br><br>

The band's video game debut was in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater with the song "Superman". Goldfinger's song "I Want" from Disconnection Notice is featured in Burnout Revenge on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Xbox 360, and is also featured in Burnout Legends on the PlayStation Portable."My Everything" is featured on SSX On Tour also by Electronic Arts. The single, "Spokesman", is featured on Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. Goldfinger also appeared in the Reel Big Fish video "Sell Out" for a couple of seconds.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Big D and the Kids Table frontman David McWane has said, "There are people who want to be in a band and then there are musicians." However once in while a group come along who decide to make music simply because they have no other choice--and those are the acts who tend to stick around. For the past fourteen years Big D And The Kids Table have proven that regardless of fame or poverty they will fo...rever be addicted musicians--and their latest full-length Fluent In Stroll is the apex of their decade-and-a-half long career.<br><br>

The best person who ever put it was [Warped Tour founder] Kevin Lyman, McWane explains. "My girlfriend once asked him if we were a big band and he replied, 'I'll tell you like this, they've been around for 14 years and each year they're relevant.' I think that's a great description of what this band is all about."<br><br>

"I personally like shows where you have to prove yourself," McWane responds when asked which of the band's thousands of live performances stick out in his head. "The Warped Tours and the Dropkick Murphys tours that we did were cool because when you've been in a band for as long as we have and you get to play shows where you have to prove yourselves you have that same first-show anxiety," he continues. "When you play the shows where everyone in the place loves you, then it turns more into entertaining--and that's cool, but that's not where I personally come from," he elaborates. "That might sound kind of weird, but I like the underdog shows more because it adds a little bit of spice and kick to it." The good news is that armed with a record as ambitious as For the Damned, the Dumb, and the Delirious, the band will undoubtedly have to prove themselves all over again in sweaty clubs all over the world.<br><br>

"I think we have the same aspirations with this disc that we do with every record and that involves our little pow wow of saying, 'Don't you think music is shit?'" McWane--who is also an accomplished author currently working on a second book of poetry, a collection of Big D lyrics, two short films and a retrospective DVD about the band called Built Up From Nothing--explains when asked about his personal expectations for For the Damned, the Dumb, and the Delirious. "Music groups have always recognized and applauded for creating something new and different for listeners, yet today it seems that artists are recognized for making what's already been or what's most the same," he elaborates. "We really tried to push the envelope the way artists used to do and all we've ever wanted was to be able to play music in front of a lot of people that love our songs," he summarizes. "If we could play on one stage in front of the world, we would do it."<br /><br />

                As Eric Hutchinson journeyed toward the making of Moving Up Living Down, the delightfully witty and supremely wise follow-up to his hit debut Sounds Like This, he developed a very simple rule regarding new songs.<br><br>

“I traveled so long and got to see so many people and places,” he says. “And sharing music with the fans every night got me thinking: The best concerts are when people sing along with me. So for the next one, what kind of songs do I want people singing with me? What kind of songs do I want people dancing to?”<br><br>

Get ready to sing and dance.<br><br>

Road-tested in every setting from a converted garage in Salt Lake City to the 30,000-seat Calgary Saddledome, from San Diego to Dubai, the artist and songs alike bear a playful confidence that was boosted along the way. As the Washington, DC-raised singer, pianist and guitarist traveled the world over the course of several years, word of mouth about his irresistible songs and engaging presence brought out consistently growing concert crowds. That helped turn the song “Rock & Roll” into an international hit (certified Gold in the U.S., Platinum in New Zealand, Norway and Australia) and the album hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart, ultimately selling more than 250,000 copies. The songs “OK, It’s Alright With Me” (top 5 on AAA radio) and “Oh!” also caught fire, helping push total single sales past the million mark.<br><br>

After a brief respite to nail down the writing at home in New York, he took to the road again to make this album in Los Angeles with producer Mike Elizondo (Eminem, Regina Spektor) and London with Martin Terefe (Jason Mraz, James Morrison).<br><br>

On Moving Up Living Down, all of Eric’s ever-widening musical embraces are brought into play, from the exuberant folk-pop bounce of “Watching You Watch Him” (the first single, which debuted on the season premiere of ABC-TV’s “Grey’s Anatomy”) through the reggae lilt of opener “Talk is Cheap” through the soul grounding of “The Basement.” The music is tuneful and rhythmic. The lyrics are engaging and reflective. Comparisons, as always, are tough, but you wouldn’t go wrong thinking of a spectrum that includes Paul Simon, the Beatles and Stevie Wonder, all integrated into a truly Hutchinsonian whole. <br><br>

“The biggest inspirations of the album were the cities I visited, the inspiration and rhythms of the people,” he says. It’s all about missing people (the so-close-yet-so-far-away family and friends of “The People I Know”), reconnecting with the spirit that got him started (“In the First Place”) and finding communities in unexpected places. Take “The Basement,” for example.<br><br>

“I love soul music, so it’s sort of an homage to that. One night after a show in Northampton, Massachusetts, the promoter brought us to a club called The Basement -- and it was a full-on rock ‘n’ roll party, DJ playing songs from the ‘50s and ‘60s… It was like, ‘I found my people!’ I named some of my favorite artists at the end -- Isley Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye - I just love that stuff!” <br><br>

And “Best Days” came straight out of the last few years’ roaming.<br><br>

“I was reflecting on all the travel I’d done, thinking about the life I have,” he says. “It’s cliche maybe, but these are the best days of our lives. That’s a surprise to me,” he says. “I sort of think of myself as a cynical optimist. I’m a little suspicious, but in the end I think things work out for the best.”<br><br>

That was the case with finding producers Elizondo and Terefe, who provided environments that allowed Hutchinson’s growing creativity to flourish.<br><br>

“I’m a big hip-hop fan, which sometimes people laugh at,” he says. “I wanted the record to be rhythmic, feel big but have the intimacy of the lyrics. I’m also a big pop music fan, Beatles and Paul Simon. Mike Elizondo comes from hip-hop, but is a big Beatles fan. I walked into his studio and saw he had all these Beatles pictures up and I knew I was in the right place!”<br><br>

The combination clicked, taking Hutchinson in some unexpected directions.<br><br>

“I’m always on the search for new sounds and on ‘Watching You Watch Him’ I was trying to figure out what kind of solo to have, Mike suggested a requinto jarocho, a stringed instrument from Veracruz – and he just nailed it.”<br><br>

The London sessions with Terefe were just as inspiring.<br><br>

“I was staying nearby and walked to the studio, got to learn London by night,” he says. “He has a cool set-up like a living room. You sit, playing on a couch. I learned a lot on that couch, about how to make music. It created a lot of freedom in the recording process that showed up in the songs.”<br><br>

The road remains Hutchinson’s favorite place to make music, of course. “You’re hosting a party, inviting people in and making sure they’re taken care of the whole time.”<br><br>

Reciprocally, it’s a fertile world for his art. “Breakdown More” is one song that in particular benefited from that two-way communication. It goes all the way back to his college days, appearing on an early and very limited-release live EP. But somehow fans became familiar with it, he says, and began requesting -- or demanding -- it at concerts.<br><br>

“That one just never went away,” he says. “It always felt good live. Something about it stuck with me. When we got to the studio we really dug in, it really caught its own fire.” <br><br>

He relishes that sometimes circuitous process, which has given him an album as emotionally complex -- and compelling -- as Hutchinson is showing himself to be. <br><br>

“The album’s called Moving Up Living Down because it’s about that chutes and ladders lifestyle,” he says. “There’s no end game. It’s about growing pains and I think I’ve grown a lot, experienced a lot since the first album and this is the next step. Sometimes it can be frustrating, learning on the fly. But it’s all worked out really well. Especially as I’ve made this album I’ve had time to reflect over what’s happened in the last few years. Really inspiring, proud and I feel lucky, which is a word I never got to use before. I feel really lucky.”<br><br>

But the journey’s hardly over. As the title of one song states, he’s “Not There Yet.”<br /><br />

                So many decisions in life and in the music we love can come down to a critical tug between the logic in our heads and the hot red blood beating through our hearts. Seattle's The Head and the Heart live authentically in that crux, finding joy and beauty wedged there. Their music pulses effervescently--both explosively danceable and intuitively intelligent. With Americana roots and strong vocal harmonics that swell like a river, this band finds its anchor in solid songwriting that has even the jaded humming along by the second listen.<br><br>

Leaving a variety of day jobs and academic pursuits, The Head and the Heart came together in the summer of 2009, during frequent visits to the open mic night at Conor Byrne in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. California-transplant Josiah Johnson and Virginia-native Jonathan Russell formed the core songwriting partnership, quickly adding keyboardist Kenny Hensley to the mix. Kenny, then 21, had packed up his piano and moved up to Seattle from California to pursue musical score-writing. The luminous Charity Rose Thielen, violin and vocals, had just returned from a year of studying and playing music in Paris. Drummer Tyler Williams cold left a successful band in Virginia after Jon sent him the demo of "Down in the Valley," relocating across states to be a part of this. Finally, Chris Zasche, was bartending at Conor Byrne and mentioned one day that he'd be happy to play bass for the nascent band. It all felt right: The Head and the Heart was born. Whether penning songs on the beach at Seattle's Discovery Park, or working out melodies in the piano practice rooms at the Seattle Public Library, Charity describes the early months of the band's existence as touched by a shared purpose and connection. She recalls an email she sent to Josiah that summer, confessing that she was "sleepless and penniless, but inspired nonetheless."<br><br>

The band entered Seattle's Studio Litho in early 2010 to record these songs that had been kicking and twisting in the catalytic development of their live show. Recorded by Shawn Simmons at Studio Litho and Steven Aguilar at Bearhead Studio, the band was selling burned copies in handmade denim sleeves at local shows within a few weeks. Self-released in June 2010, the debut album helped build an impressive head-of-steam for the band through the second 1/2 of the year, gaining fans at influential Seattle station KEXP, local record shops (a consistent top 10 seller for Easy Street and the #1 album of 2010 at Sonic Boom), and venues up and down the West Coast, culminating with signing to Sub Pop Records in November. For the 2011 re-release of the album, "Sounds like Hallelujah" has been re-recorded, live favorite "Rivers and Roads" has been added, and the album has been re-mastered.<br><br>

The songs resulting from those first inspired months pick at the multicolored threads of leaving home, finding home, and through that process of deconstruction, finding yourself. These are songs about crossing rivers and roads to get to the one you love, about family far away, and the desire to chase Technicolor dreams down foreign horizons. When people hear these songs, or see the band live, the first thing they have to do is tell someone else. Their shows are, simply, one hell of a lot of breathless fun. Each song explodes into a potent supernova on stage, where half the audience is zealously singing along with every lyric, and the other half is wishing they knew the words. The band has accepted nearly every show offered to them in the past year, from backyards strung with Christmas lights to coffee shops, open mics, and even high school classrooms in Middle America. From the first months of the band's life, their reputation as a phenomenal live band has preceded them wherever they play.<br><br>

The strength of Josiah, Jon and Charity's vocal harmonies on the album makes it feel like these three were born to pour their voices together, as the band's songs revel in jaunty bass lines with ebullient handclaps peppering the best moments. A palette of orchestral elements weave their way through the album, including cello, glockenspiel, and violin, all shading in the songs' development. For all the times your toes tap while enjoying this band, often the lightness will deceptively belie the depth of ache in the lyrics when you sit down to really listen. There is magic in the music, but not magic contrived by trickery or posturing. "It seems actually that the more genuine and honest we are in the songwriting and performing, the more people relate to that transparency," Charity muses.<br><br>

This is an album for people who unabashedly sing and drum along on the steering wheel, and also for those who appreciate a well-crafted collection of songs that build into something wholly beautiful.<br><br>

There is in this music a counter-cultural optimism, with roots that grow deep and melodies that lodge themselves far into that place inside you where the head meets the heart.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                It’s difficult to say where Night Beds begins, but it could be here: August 2006, a young Winston Yellen is invited to a longtime friend’s apartment. They talk, they record a little aimlessly, and something exciting emerges. Maybe it’s a little later, when one is studying engineering in Nashville, and the other remains behind, an unhappy captive of secondary education. It could be any number of moments, really, along a series of migrations, but probably here: the summer of 2008, back in Colorado Springs, when they write the first Night Beds song, “You Were Afraid.”<br><br>
God knows that we try to do the best we can<br><br>
After that there is a lot of time spent in basements, a lot of alcohol, a lot of irreverent tuning, but not all that much need for talk. Most things are shared, understood: in thin mountain air, or in a waterlogged summer atmosphere, there can be a sense that breathing is effortful, that sleep is easy but not restful. The songs that come out of those first few years, collected on three EPs (night beds, every fire; every joy, and hide from it), are an exercise in catharsis. They’re deeply ringing things, washed in whiskey. The sound is like something emergent from a tunnel. It may be the red eye of a cigarette in the dark, or it may be the dawn peeking out.<br><br>
Somewhere we might find softer light<br><br>
“It was never thought. It just was always what felt good.” So the songs come together over acoustic guitars, over the first skeletal melodies, and then they grow. Yellen’s voice takes on a pure kind of thirst when wrapped in the sonic landscapes he devises. It’s searching. It’s taken several years to map everything out, but after a hiatus spent driving the deserts and prairies and coastal roads of the United States, sleeping in a hatchback or on friendly couches – after a long time spent alone – Night Beds has found a home in Nashville.  Soon it will see the release of Country Sleep, a full-length album in the spirit of the vagabond, in the winding path to a place of good rest.<br><br>

                The appeal of a modern, on the rise indie band like Jukebox the Ghost is simple: They write catchy songs. On top of that, they’re dynamic, skilled musicians. The band’s records are carefully structured, yet wildly diverse affairs. And the live show? Energetic, crowd-pleasing, cathartic.<br><br>

The Philly trio’s new album, produced by Peter Katis (Interpol, The National) and set for release this fall on Yep Roc, highlights all of these elements over 11 tracks, each one leaving its own unique sonic footprint. But constructing and arranging the songs to their full potential took years of preparation, both on the road and in all of the basements, houses, hotel rooms and studios where the songs were born.<br><br>

“There was never a lull in songwriting, even when we were touring.” explains guitarist/co-vocalist Tommy Siegel. “We went into the studio with 25 nearly-finished and arranged songs, and we put a lot of time into crafting each one. It was a conscious effort on all of our parts to mature as a band.”<br><br>

Since their 2008 debut, Let Live and Let Ghosts, a sunny, piano-led explosion of pop exuberance, JTG has logged hundreds of shows and thousands of hours on tour – all of which helped the guys develop the patience and perspective needed to deliver a more intricate and serious second record.<br><br>

“Sometimes, in the past, we were received as being this bubbly and jumpy and happy group,” says Ben Thornewill, Jukebox’s pianist and other vocalist. “But this record seems like we’re sounding more thoughtful and personal. Besides, you’re going to think and write differently after 300 shows. People change, different things happen to you, you get some new influences, and the way you do your songwriting and arranging is going to be different.”<br><br>

“It’s not wrong to say we’re fun, upbeat guys,” adds Siegel, who stayed upbeat during the album’s recording despite scheduling it around vocal surgery—a by-product of spending two years on the road (note: post-surgery, Tommy is fine). “But we’re real people, we’ve had real troubles, and all of that’s going to affect us. Besides, I think the ‘happy-fun’ label was a bit of hyperbole – I mean, half of the songs on our first record were about the apocalypse.”<br><br>

Originally formed during college in Washington D.C., Jukebox the Ghost (the name’s an amalgam of Captain Beefheart and Nabakov references) won accolades for that first record, Let Live and Let Ghosts, which Spin called “a refreshing reminder that the lighthearted electricity of a fantastic pop song is still filled with live wires.” The band – Thornewill, Siegel and drummer Jesse Kristin – jelled quickly, despite their disparate musical backgrounds in everything from classical piano to prog to indie to 80s Brit-pop. Collectively, the group delivered an unabashedly upbeat, playful sound with a sly dark streak (see: the aforementioned apocalyptic lyrics).<br><br>

JTG’s pop sensibility is still on display on the new record, but now rounded out with more emotional heft and an expanded musical palate. For starters, there’s an emergence of synths, most notably on the Phoenix-like opener “Schizophrenia.” (Says Thornewill: “I was such a classical pianist for a long time that I was sort of against using them…and then I started fooling around and realized how much they could open up our sound.”). Elsewhere, the album veers through gorgeous AM radio throwbacks (“The Summer Sun”), Beatles-esque twists and turns (“Mistletoe”) and even a little prog-rock in “The Sun,” “The Sun (Interlude)” and “The Stars,” a three-part “philosophical/cosmological pondering” by Siegel that’s actually quite…dance-able.<br><br>

Jukebox the Ghost“Doing dance beats wasn’t natural for us,” admits Siegel. “But we had done a cover of New Order’s ‘Temptation’ a little while back, and every time we played it our fans went crazy. So I think that really influenced us to try something new on here.”<br><br>

With one exception on the new album (“Carrying”), Thornewill and Siegel tend to write songs on their own, with Kristin serving as an unofficial producer during the arrangement sessions. Although the two writers differ in style–”Tommy’s songs are highly imaginative and story-like while Ben’s tend to be more emotional and reflective,” says Kristin–several of the new tracks play off of each other, lyrically and thematically. Common threads, both accidental and purposeful, abound — From the concepts of “nobody” vs. “everybody” (“Nobody” and “The Popular Thing”), insanity (Ben’s track “Schizophrenia,” Tommy’s song “Half-Crazy.”) or even sun imagery (Ben’s “The Summer Sun,” Tommy’s “The Sun.”) (For more explanations on the songs, see the band’s track-by-track commentary, included below).<br><br>

Helping to round out Jukebox’s sound this time out was producer Peter Katis, best known for his work with Interpol, The National, Fanfarlo and other, decidedly less-animated rock groups. “There’s simplicity about the records he’s done that we love,” says Kristin. “And we thought, given his affinity for melancholy, dark music, he could bring a balance to our songs.” Katis kept the sessions loose, giving the record a vibe closer to their live sound. As the drummer notes: “He let the music be what it was, and didn’t substantially change the structures or melodies, which we really appreciated.”<br><br>

As for the Beatles fixation of the record (like “Nobody,” which Thornewill calls their “most McCartney-esque song”), the band gives some credit to their adopted hometown of Philadelphia, where the group relocated to from Washington D.C. on a whim after their first record. “The music scene here is amazing,” says Siegel. “A lot of bands here, like Dr. Dog, have a heavy Beatles vibe going– I think that made us realize that it’s OK for us to wear our influences on our sleeves a little bit.”<br><br>

With new songs and a new direction in hand, JTG plan to spend the next year on the road, hopefully matching the 300+ shows the band did between albums one and two. It was out there, with the likes of Ben Folds, Adam Green (Moldy Peaches) and Ra Ra Riot where the group built up a fervent, wide-ranging fanbase. “Our growth as a band has been from word-of-mouth and just being on tour,” says Siegel. “We seem to attract everyone from hipsters to parents to kids to college students. It never ceases to surprise me.”<br><br>

Besides delivering a raucous live show, one other thing will stay constant with Jukebox the Ghost, newfound maturity or not — the lack of a bass player. “That’s how we started,” says Kristin. “And we take a lot of pride in coloring every section of every song just with the three of us. We’ve sort of proven to be a successful oddity without one.”<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                On “Dreamers,” the dance-laden lullaby and lead single from Savoir Adore’s new album Our Nature, Paul Hammer and Deidre Muro invite listeners into a magical dream world.  Such worlds are nothing new to the fantasy pop duo, who inadvertently became a fixture of Brooklyn’s indie scene as the result of a dare. In 2007, as disheartened solo artists, they whimsically retreated out of the city to a rural studio with two rules: “48 hours.  No acoustic guitars.” They returned with The Adventures of Mr. Pumpernickel and The Girl with Animals in Her Throat (Cantora), a concept-driven EP set in a fairy tale land that narrates the tragedy of Gloria and her unrequited love. On 2009’s full length In The Wooded Forest (Cantora), they expounded on the EP’s mythical landscape. But where Savoir Adore’s previous releases have surveyed these worlds at a distance, Our Nature zooms in, putting our inner landscapes and relationships at the core of every track.  In that vein, the recordings themselves are intentionally more crisp, aurally expansive and intriguing.<br><br>


Our Nature itself is both a collection of catchy indie pop songs and a dramatic narrative. “Dreamers” functions as its prologue; on it, Muro insists her subject not worry and “keep on sleeping,” while Hammer confronts the inevitable transience of dreaming: “Where we are isn’t just a place where everything remains.” And so Our Nature thrusts into its tenuous drama: the unlikely love story of Girl and Monster (“Loveliest Creature”). At times as fantastical as its premise (“Regalia,” “Sea of Gold”), at others as accessible as radio pop (“Sparrow,” “Anywhere You Go”), the album seamlessly blends ‘60s invasion, ‘80s new wave and ‘90s alternative with a more contemporary, digital creative process. Others have recognized Savoir Adore’s sound as “musically and lyrically brave” (NME) and “irresistibly melodic indie pop” (Nylon).  In 2009 and 2010, The L Magazine and The New York Post both named the band to their top bands to watch lists. So now, look no further. After two years of finding inspiration in a wide range of experiences, from neuroscience lectures to tales as old as time, Savoir Adore is back with Our Nature.<br><br>


Muro and Hammer were both born into musical households. Muro’s father is an electronic music writer and performer, her mother an organist, and her brother a composer. Muro herself learned to play the piano and violin and trained as a jazz vocalist while also in her mother’s church choir. When she arrived at NYU, she joined a songwriter’s club, which is where she met Hammer, who grew up with famed keyboardist and composer Jan Hammer (Mahavishnu Orchestra) as his father. While Savoir Adore often keeps their music playful, it is also serious work akin to keeping up the family business. Nowhere is this reverence more resonant than on ITWF’s “Wonderlake” and its complimentary number on Our Nature, “Sea of Gold.” On both tracks, Hammer and Muro ask big questions about family history and identity: How did I get here? Who am I now?<br><br>


As an ambivalent reaction to their years spent in the Greenwich Village songwriter scene, 2007’s eccentric and unexpected The Adventures of Mr. Pumpernickel and the Girl with Animals in Her Throat was the beginning of the duo’s creative response to these questions about musical identity. After their two-day dare was complete, they posted some tracks to a MySpace page under the hastily forged moniker Savoir Adore, a French phrase that grammatically fails to merge “knowing” and “love.” The name stuck and the project gained momentum. Cantora Records released the EP as the band began to work on a full length. With the release of 2009’s In The Wooded Forest, the New York music press embraced Savoir Adore and set them on a path to expand their audience nationally and internationally. Band members Tim McCoy (drums), Gary Atturio (bass) and Alex Foote (guitar), who took part in Our Nature’s recording process, rounded out the band’s live show as Savoir Adore shared the stage with MGMT, Los  Campesinos, Oh Land, and Toro Y Moi.<br><br>


In the summer of 2010, the band toured the UK and France, including shows at Koko/Club NME and The Secret Garden Party. Their songs have been featured in various commercials (Almay, Citi, Yoplait), TV shows (Pretty Little Liars, Drop Dead Diva, Huge) and video games (Kinect Adventurer). During the 2012 Academy Awards, Tide premiered its new Tide Pods campaign featuring Savoir Adore’s cover of Men Without Hats’ “Pop Goes the World” (available on iTunes).<br><br>


In late 2011, Savoir Adore offered a sneak peak of Our Nature, releasing “Dreamers” as a 7” on Neon Gold Records. In 2012, Savoir Adore invites lovely creatures the world over to join in their epic saga as they take Our Nature over the river and through the woods, down interstates and beyond!<br /><br />

                Kelly Pratt is Bright Moments.<br><br>

He's the guy up at night by himself, stitching songs together in his New York City apartment all winter. There's a special art to making an album in the spare seconds that the rest of a regular life can't quite reach. Recorded track-by-track-by-track with Pratt on most of the instruments in his apartment studio during the New York City winter of 2010, this slow-motion musicianship became Natives (Luaka Bop).<br><br>

Natives may be your first official introduction to the music of Bright Moments but if you have spent time with some of the most beloved indie albums of the last decade, you'll quickly realize that you know him well. He is the multi-instrumentalist whose trumpet sparks across so many of Beirut's songs and whose harmonizing vocals is a central component to the band's robust live performances. He has also shouldered everything from flugelhorn to flute to bring Arcade Fire's Neon Bible to life, and was part of the horn section that LCD Soundsystem used during its sunset days.<br /><br />

                Pauly-tics is a 60-90 minute Showtime Networks special that will air in October/November and stars Pauly Shore in a LIVE stand up performance with other political comedians and celebrities featured.<br><br>
Pauly-tics is a fun, playful format with a live DJ who will banter with Pauly.  Pauly and other comics will be on the main stage performing their own form of political material.  One of the segments of the live performances will be a professional moderator working with Pauly as if he were running for President.  Another element on the special will be Pauly doing a roundtable, subject TBA.<br><br>
The special will also have pre-taped packages that will be intercut in 3-5 minute increments throughout the special and will show Pauly doing very simple walk and talks with famous politicians, news anchors, political pundits, and lobbyists.  Overall, Paulty-tics will be an entertaining, upbeat special, with no pranks.<br /><br />

                Pauly-tics is a 60-90 minute Showtime Networks special that will air in October/November and stars Pauly Shore in a LIVE stand up performance with other political comedians and celebrities featured.<br><br>
Pauly-tics is a fun, playful format with a live DJ who will banter with Pauly.  Pauly and other comics will be on the main stage performing their own form of political material.  One of the segments of the live performances will be a professional moderator working with Pauly as if he were running for President.  Another element on the special will be Pauly doing a roundtable, subject TBA.<br><br>
The special will also have pre-taped packages that will be intercut in 3-5 minute increments throughout the special and will show Pauly doing very simple walk and talks with famous politicians, news anchors, political pundits, and lobbyists.  Overall, Paulty-tics will be an entertaining, upbeat special, with no pranks.<br /><br />

                If it's 5 A.M. and you're still dancing, chances are you're running on Scissor Sisters time. For a band that sprung out of downtown NYC clubs like The Cock in the Lower East Side and Luxx in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (a launch pad for the modern electroclash sound), it's only natural that all things after dark fit the Scissor Sisters like a glove. They twisted disco, New York electro and good old fashioned Elton John-era rock n' roll into an explosion of infectious dance floor anthems that appeals to just about anyone with a pulse. All are welcome at this party. If pop has a responsibility to be music for all people, the Scissor Sisters -- vocalists Jake Shears and Ana Matronic, multi-instrumentalist Baby Daddy and lead guitar Del Marquis -have made that type of pop music experience their battle cry.<br><br>

While the heart of the Scissor Sisters has always been shaped around the exuberance of nightlife, their success has spilled out far past the New York club scene and into the global mainstream. After the B-side to the band's first single, a jacked-up disco version of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb", became a mainstay in nightclubs across the globe and topped the charts throughout Europe, their eponymous debut album became an international smash -- eventually scoring a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Record for "Comfortably Numb," becoming the top-selling album of 2004 in the UK and sweeping the Brit Awards for that year.<br><br>

The follow-up, "Ta-Dah," topped the UK charts for 27 weeks and their single "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'" was the fourth best-selling single in the UK in 2006. Their latest effort, the pulsating, critical-success "Night Work" (co-produced by the club wizard Stuart Price who is best known for his work on Madonna's "Confessions on a Dancefloor"), debuted at #2 on the UK Charts, #1 on the US Billboard Independent Album charts, and in the top 10 in several international territories.<br><br>

Entertainers at heart, Scissor Sisters have earned a reputation for their humorous, controversial and outright transgressive, live performances that have filled venues from New York's Bowery Ballroom to London's O2 Arena. There's really nothing the band wont do to make you dance and get lost in the beat. They've infamously collaborated with Jim Henson's Muppets for their opening performance at the Brit Awards in 2005, and in 2010, stole the show at Glastonbury when they performed a duet (and grinded) with Kylie Minogue for their single "Any Which Way."<br><br>

Despite becoming chart toppers and festival headliners throughout the world, the Scissor Sisters have never turned away from the all-inclusive magic of their former downtown stomping grounds. Working in the great tradition of dance music that seeks endless possibility, the band flips musical and aesthetic conventions on their head in favor of a belief that music will set you free. Behind the sweat, exuberant grooves and joyously unrestrained performances is an open invitation. Thankfully, we're all on the list.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Baltimore U.S.A based, Rye Rye, already heralded by NME in trends for 2008 as “the latest prodigy from the Spank Rock stable that has A&Rs frothing,” is the new face of female hip –hop …this is Nu-Hop! Nu-Hop had been stripped of negativity and this 17 year old rapper is throwing a fresh, unique, dance fueled, fun direction into the mix.

Rye Ryes debut single “Shake It To The Ground” assisted by DJ Blagstarr has received global attention, resulting with 1,000,000 youtube video views, the backing of Hollywood blogger extraordinaire Perez Hilton, a feature on MTV U.S.A News and currently in the UK the video is on MTV Base/ MTV2 / MTV dance. Rye Rye is a protégé of British/Sri Lankan femcee M.I.A, whom were both on the live explosive uberactive Kala tour, along with rapping on M.I.A s recent hit “Paper Planes” she also performed with her on the David Letterman show U.S.A.

This teen sensation is at the helm of a movement that is already encouraging people to look out of the old school hip-hop box! Mentioned in April 08 in the No.2 spot in NMEs: “ The Future 50 bands, artists and innovators driving music forward” alongside M.I.A, The Cool Kids, Santogold, and airplay support from Radio 1s Rob Da Bank, Rye Rye is a new force to watch out for.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Baltimore U.S.A based, Rye Rye, already heralded by NME in trends for 2008 as “the latest prodigy from the Spank Rock stable that has A&Rs frothing,” is the new face of female hip –hop …this is Nu-Hop! Nu-Hop had been stripped of negativity and this 17 year old rapper is throwing a fresh, unique, dance fueled, fun direction into the mix.

Rye Ryes debut single “Shake It To The Ground” assisted by DJ Blagstarr has received global attention, resulting with 1,000,000 youtube video views, the backing of Hollywood blogger extraordinaire Perez Hilton, a feature on MTV U.S.A News and currently in the UK the video is on MTV Base/ MTV2 / MTV dance. Rye Rye is a protégé of British/Sri Lankan femcee M.I.A, whom were both on the live explosive uberactive Kala tour, along with rapping on M.I.A s recent hit “Paper Planes” she also performed with her on the David Letterman show U.S.A.

This teen sensation is at the helm of a movement that is already encouraging people to look out of the old school hip-hop box! Mentioned in April 08 in the No.2 spot in NMEs: “ The Future 50 bands, artists and innovators driving music forward” alongside M.I.A, The Cool Kids, Santogold, and airplay support from Radio 1s Rob Da Bank, Rye Rye is a new force to watch out for.<br /><br />

                Recorded in just two weeks not far from the band's Philadelphia homebase, the Disco Biscuits' sixth studio album Otherwise Law Abiding Citizens is their best attempt yet to capture the essence of their legendary live sets and distill it into a stereo-devouring electronic monster. On the heels of their powerhouse Fall 2010 tour, the Biscuits took over Studio 4 in Conshohocken, PA with Grammy Award-winning producer Phil Nicolo to turn out these nine classic Biscuits tracks, many of which have been staples of their live sets for the past several years. The end result is a cohesive album consistent with the band's live roots -- as eclectic and energetic as any of their signature shows.<br><br>
Otherwise Law Abiding Citizens was unveiled to Biscuits fans for the first time with an exclusive stealth release at the landmark sold-out Camp Bisco 10 in July 2011. Fans gathered around car stereos to blast the collection of fresh jams before anyone else in the country could hear. The album was finally released worldwide to rave reviews as the Biscuits left the stage following their festival-closing Saturday night set. The band finished out 2011 with national appearances on the Identity Tour and a crushing five-night New Year's Run featuring their first ever New Year's concerts in Chicago.<br><br>
With only select appearances on the books so far for 2012, the Disco Biscuits' six sets at Camp Bisco are already the subject of intense anticipation by fans all over the country -- we all look forward to seeing what they have in store!<br /><br />

                NO SCRUBS: 90’s Dance Party began in 2004 as a one-off concept party by friends and DJ partners Will Eastman and Brian Billion. The idea was simple: play both guilty pleasures and underground classics you listened to growing up in the 90’s: Salt N Pepa and Nirvana. Ace of Base and Happy Mondays. The Prodigy and Biggie.<br><br>
By its third edition, the party began to sell out the Black Cat back stage and, later, the Cat’s mainstage. In 2009, the party moved to the spacious 9:30 Club, whose sound and light systems are simply incredible, and quickly filled it with a legion of happy revelers, too. It is now the largest and longest running 90's party in DC. Rather than host No Scrubs weekly or monthly, Eastman and Billion insist on keeping the party occasional and as guilty a pleasure as they want it to be. <br><br>
NO SCRUBS is back Saturday, July 7! We’re exercising our pleasure groove to Bell Biv Devoe, TLC, C&C Music Factory, Oasis, 2Pac and everyone 90s all night long. Be sure to get there at doors for this special event which only comes around a couple times per year. Look forward to seeing you there!!!<br /><br />

                “I wanna shake up your system/I wanna rattle your bones/I wanna take you to the stars/And then I’ll leave you alone.” “Farther Down”

Like their name, Neon Trees are a combination of slick pop hooks and sturdy organic rock, both melodic and hard-hitting, their anthems of adolescent angst, longing, love lost and found, delivered with the kind of heart-on-the-sleeve passion that only comes from hard work and commitment.

Their Mercury Records debut, Habits, produced by friend, singer/guitarist Tim Pagnotta, is a refreshing blast of timeless rock energy and spirit that wouldn’t sound out of place at any point from ‘60s garage-rock to 2010 dance rock, with the first single, “Animal,” taking off from a round of weaving, angular guitars into a song equally at home in the arena as on the dance floor, a paean to sexual longing in which singer/front man Tyler Glenn wails, “Take a bite of my heart tonight.,” and you have no reason to doubt his sincerity.<br /><br />

                "Penguin Prison is an electro-pop act from New York that made its commercial recording debut in 2009 in association with Neon Gold Records. Comprised of Chris Glover, a producer, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist, Penguin Prison is often compared to contemporary electro-pop acts such as Hot Chip, LCD Soundsystem, and Miike Snow. Glover made his commercial recording debut as Penguin Prison with the Animal Animal/A Funny Thing EP in 2009 on Neon Gold Records. Another double-sided single, The Worse It Gets/Something I'm Not, followed on the label in 2010. A self-titled debut album arrived in 2011 on Downtown Records. In addition to his production output, Glover made a name for himself as Penguin Prison with a bunch of remixes for the likes of Marina & the Diamonds ("I Am Not a Robot"), Sébastien Tellier ("Fingers of Steel"), Goldfrapp ("Rocket"), Erik Hassle ("Hurtful"), and others. As a live act, Penguin Prison is a trio comprised of Conrad Stern-Ascher on synthesizers and Ernesto Karolys on drums, in addition to Glover on vocals and guitar." - Jason Birchmeier, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                "What does your band sound like?" The most common, and unavoidable, question asked of a musician. One friend said we sound like Smart Pop. Another likened us to the West Coast Blondie. When people ask, I usually say "Have you ever been to Venice Beach late at night, when the cops have stopped patrolling, and you're not sure which shadows the drug dealers and pickpockets are hiding in, but the Ocean is loud and the Air is wet and you feel safe because you're with someone you know? It sounds exactly like that feels!"<br><br>
I don't actually say that, but it's definitely more fun than "A really good rock band. I think you'd like it."<br /><br />

                "La Coka Nostra is a hip-hop supergroup featuring members of House of Pain (Everlast, Danny Boy, and DJ Lethal), Non Phixion (Ill Bill), Special Teamz (Slaine), plus solo artist Big Left. Formed in 2005, the group was originally a loose collective, but a year later they decided to begin work on a La Coka Nostra album. Tracks posted to the Internet, mixtapes, plus Ill Bill's 2007 album Black Metal -- a "La Coka Nostra Presents" release -- all appeared before the group was signed to the Suburban Noize label in late 2008. They spent 2009 on the road playing summer festivals and promoting their debut album, A Brand You Can Trust." - David Jeffries, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                For more than fifteen years, the name Jedi Mind Tricks has become synonymous with raw, gritty underground hip-hop. From their debut album, The Psycho-social, in 1996 to their seminal sophomore release,Violent By Design, to their musical expansion heard on Servants and Heaven, Kings in Hell, JMT has made an indelible impression on the independent music scene while arguably forging its own subgenre of rap. Led by the fiery vocals of controversial frontman, Vinnie Paz, and his venerable rhyme partner, Jus Allah, the group has built one of the most critically-acclaimed and commercially-successful careers in independent music.<br><br>
Though JMT rarely appears on Billboard charts, their success is most accurately measured in the passion and respect of their growing legions of hardcore fans who have packed JMT shows around the world from Boston to Bogota to Bucharest. JMT’s music is defiant and their longevity is a testament to their blue-collar work ethic born from the bloodlines of their hometown, Philadelphia.<br><br>
On October 25, 2011, JMT is set to drop its seventh studio album, “Violence Begets Violence”, through Vinnie Paz’s own imprint, Enemy Soil. Though JMT fans can expect more of the uncompromising, unrelenting brand of hardcore rap music that has become the group’s signature sound, “Violence Begets Violence,” marks a change as longtime JMT producer, Stoupe, hands over production duties to a new wave of talented producers honed on the JMT sound, but set on creating a fresh take on a classic formula.<br><br>
Jedi Mind Tricks “Violence Begets Violence” is available on CD, vinyl, and via digital download on October 25, 2011.<br /><br />

                "Bethany Cosentino was no stranger to the stage when she began working on recordings with bandmate Bobb Bruno under the name Best Coast in 2009. A former child actress, Cosentino had started writing songs in her teens, and had garnered a strong online following by the time she was 17 thanks to a handful of squeaky-clean pop tunes she made available on her MySpace page under the nom de teen pop Bethany Sharayah. "I had interest from major labels," she said in a 2009 interview with PopSense. "And it was kind of overwhelming and I realized that I wasn't ready to be a ‘pop princess.'" In the years that followed, Cosentino put in time as a member of the spacy experimental pop group Pocahaunted and went to school in New York. She moved back to Los Angeles in 2009, at which point she started working with Bruno on Best Coast's first demos.<br><br>
Drawing inspiration from '60s surf rock and girl groups, Best Coast's noisy lo-fi sound gave a nod to contemporaneous acts like Hot Lava, the Vivian Girls, and Brilliant Colors. Best Coast's first year saw a flurry of little releases: a self-titled 7" single on Art Fag; a cassette tape release, Where the Boys Are, on the U.K. label Blackest Rainbow; a split 7", Up All Night, on Atelier Ciseaux; an EP, Make You Mine, on Group Tightener; and a self-titled 7" on Black Iris. Best Coast had become something of a sensation by the time 2009 came to a close; the band enjoyed a bit of attention from the media (notably from Nylon magazine), and Make You Mine made its way onto a few year-end lists. The band embarked on its first U.S. tour early the following year, sharing the stage with the Vivian Girls. Their profile continued to rise in 2010 with the release of "When I'm with You," which was accompanied by an adorably cute video. The duo signed to Mexican Summer Records and began work on a debut album. Meanwhile, Cosentino made a summer single for Converse (a collaboration with Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij and rapper Kid Cudi) and Best Coast added a full-time drummer, ex-Vivian Girl Ali Koehler. The group's album Crazy for You, which featured Cosentino's cat, Snacks, on the cover, was released in July." - Margaret Reges, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Four years have gone by since Nikki, Jessi, and Kelley Darlin spat in their palms and slapped hands in a three-way promise that would become Those Darlins. Since then, they’ve broken hearts and broken bones, all the while honing their chops and gaining a lifetime of experiences through endless touring: bros to the bitter end. Screws Get Loose is their second album--and the first to show off drumme...r Linwood Regensburg stepping up as a songwriter. Each song bears the scars of the highs and lows they’ve soldiered through together on the road, accentuating the realities of growing up in a rock and roll band.<br><br>
This latest collection of songs reveals the Darlins’ road-weary and hardened spirits as the full-throttle charge of their freewheeling early anthems, such as “Red Light Love” and “Wild One,” has faded into the clarity and the life lessons of , “Let You Down," “Be Your Bro,” and the album's title track. In "Be Your Bro," Jessi sings “I just wanna be your brother, you just wanna be my boyfriend. I just wanna run and play in the dirt with you, you just wanna stick it in.” It’s the kind of lyric that any woman can relate to, and the kind of writing that tells a story with just enough detail to make your mind fill in the blanks and make it your own. But the album’s true tone culminates in the distant yearning of “Waste Away": “What happened that makes you wanna go face first into the ground? What happened to me that I keep followin' you around?”<br><br>
The band re-enlisted producer Jeff Curtin (Small Black) and headed down to Atlanta, GA to record Screws Get Loose with engineer Ed Rawls at his Living Room Studio (Black Lips, Jacuzzi Boys). While the band’s country punk nature is still evident, the Southern roots that shine through are more in line with the dirty South garage rock blasting out of Memphis, Atlanta, and Nashville in recent years. Haunting and hook-laden numbers such as “Hives,” “Tina Said,” and “BUMD” tussle with the confessional weight of other songs, like "Waste Away" and "Let U Down." Stylistically, the band has created a range of sounds: “Boy” is reminiscent of Spector’s summery girl pop, “Mystic Mind” is a fully-realized stoner jam, and “$” is a lesson on the slippery nature of money sung in an infestation of gang vocals.<br><br>
These songs show that life on the road is no place for the faint of heart. So, naturally, songs take shape with bold narratives, strong voices, and full-bodied performances that are no less vibrant than previous offerings, but are a little less naïve. Maturity and experience combine to open up wholly new dimensions for Those Darlins. But that doesn’t mean they have forsaken the spirit of fun and frivolity that has come to define them.<br><br>
Screws Get Loose will be released via the Oh Wow Dang label on March 29, 2011.<br /><br />

                To the delight of their legions of fans, influential indie rockers The Promise Ring have officially announced their reunion for two upcoming shows, as well as the release of a rarities compilation on Dangerbird Records. Tickets recently went on sale for The Promise Ring’s highly anticipated concerts at Milwaukee’s Turner Hall on Friday, February 24th, as well as Chicago’s Metro on Saturday, February 25th. These shows will feature the band’s classic line-up—featuring lead singer/guitarist Davey von Bohlen, drummer Dan Didier, guitarist Jason Gnewikow and bassist Scott Schoenbeck—performing songs from throughout their beloved catalog. Fans can also look forward to hearing more from The Promise Ring, as an upcoming compilation of rare live and studio tracks will follow in Summer 2012 from Dangerbird, which will also be managing the group.<br><br>

“I’m looking forward to hanging out with the guys again, playing songs and shows,” said Dan Didier of The Promise Ring. “I am also eager to get the songs that haven’t seen the light of day out into the world.”<br><br>

“I managed The Promise Ring in the late ‘90s and early 2000’s, and they broke up on the eve of Dangerbird becoming a record label,” said Jeff Castelaz, CEO and co-founder of Dangerbird. “I never dreamed that the band would be an artist on my own label, and I couldn’t be more thrilled that they are now. It’s great to have them on the label they helped inspire.”<br><br>

Formed in 1995 in Milwaukee, WI, The Promise Ring released three full-length albums on Jade Tree Records—1996’s 30° Everywhere, 1997’s Nothing Feels Good, and 1999’s Very Emergency—which garnered rave reviews and earned the band a devoted following for their unique sound, which molded indie rock into a new subgenre that became known as “emo.” The Promise Ring became the first rock band to sign with Epitaph’s Anti- Records for their highly acclaimed 2002 swan song, Wood/Water, which was produced by Stephen Street (The Smiths, Blur) at famed Jacobs Studios outside London. During their prolific career, the band toured with a first-rate group of like-minded bands including At the Drive In, Jimmy Eat World, Jets to Brazil, Burning Airlines, and many others. After an amicable break-up, the band’s sound and reputation have lived on as an important influence on countless bands. Meanwhile, Promise Ring members have enjoyed further success with other projects: Von Bohlen and Didier with their new band, Maritime, which released their fourth album, Human Hearts, on Dangerbird Records in April 2011; and Schoenbeck as a longtime member of Dashboard Confessional.<br /><br />

                In early 2008, after several years spent in Washington D.C. bands like Q And Not U and Georgie James, John Davis decided he was ready to go out and start writing and recording albums on his own. John began work on the songs that were to become the first Title Tracks album in January 2008, as the unhappy fate of Georgie James became clear. By the time that Georgie James officially split up in the summer of 2008, John had an album's worth of songs ready to go and began playing shows with a new group behind him by the end of that summer.

"It Was Easy" is the debut full-length from Title Tracks, John's solo project. It contains nine original songs and two covers (Bruce Springsteen's "Tougher Than The Rest" and The Byrds' "She Don't Care About Time"). The originals run the spectrum from the taut, angry "Every Little Bit Hurts," "Found Out" (both of which, in different recordings, were released as a single on Dischord Records in April 2009) and "Piles Of Paper" to the sunnier "Hello There" and "Steady Love" to the melancholy "At Fifteen," "No, Girl" and the title track.

Other than a turn from guest saxophonist Kriston Capps on "No, Girl," John plays all of the instruments on the record, a skill gained from his years as a drummer in Q And Not U and a guitarist/singer in Georgie James. Tracyanne Campbell of Camera Obscura performs guest vocals on two songs as well, "No, Girl" and "Tougher Than The Rest."

"It Was Easy" was released on February 9, 2010. It was recorded and produced by Nick Anderson along with John and Chad Clark at Brookland Studios and Silver Sonya Studios in D.C. in the early months of 2009. Touring followed throughout the spring of 2009 and on into the year. For live shows, John is joined by Michael Cotterman on bass and Andrew Black on drums. A new album is being written now and will be recorded in November 2010.<br /><br />

                Frank Ocean has character. He's rare. In a world that divvies up art by genre, that constantly seeks to quantify cool, he is impossible to miss, like a panda bear in a pine forest. And over the past year or so, he's become harder and harder to ignore. Frank had long labored behind the curtain—writing for Brandy, Justin Bieber, and John Legend—but after hooking up with L.A.'s Odd Future collective, he self-released 2011's nostalgia, ULTRA. mixtape, and his own star quickly rose. Original songs like "Novacane" and "Swim Good" showcased his knack for riveting storytelling and arrangement, climbed the R&B charts, and led to collaborations with Beyoncé, and Kanye West and Jay-Z. But Frank isn't about accolades and accomplishments. He's a less-is-more kind of guy, the quiet type who saves his words because his songs tell us as much about him as they do ourselves. His live show emphasizes that intimacy, closes that razor-thin gap between the man and his fans. Because as rare as he is, Frank Ocean is also familiar, both in the way he moves among us, undeniably a product of this post-everything, hustle-hard, DIY musical moment, and in the way he conveys that quality that we're all always seeking: utter timelessness.<br /><br />

                "Montezumas frontman Kristian Matsson started recording a set of rustic, gravelly-voiced tunes, ones that nodded to fellow Swedes Homesick Hank and Thomas Denver Jonsson, under the nom de solo act the Tallest Man on Earth in the early 2000s. His self-titled debut EP was released on Sweden's Gravitation Records in 2006. The "Pistol Dreams" single followed one year later, leading up to the release of the Tallest Man on Earth's first full-length album, Shallow Grave, which hit stores in 2008. Matsson spent the rest of 2008 and 2009 touring, opening for Bon Iver and John Vanderslice as well as playing solo shows. After signing with Dead Oceans, Matsson released The Wild Hunt in April of 2010, which was quickly followed by a five-song EP titled Sometimes the Blues Is Just a Passing Bird. His third studio full-length, 2012's There's No Leaving Now, eschewed the urgency and austerity of The Wild Hunt for a more relaxed and conversational approach." - Margaret Reges, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                RAC (Remix Artist Collective)'s remixes have been reinventing the art of remixing and gathering widespread acclaim since the collective's creation in 2007. The newest expansion of the RAC family is RAC DJs, another creative teaming of André Anjos and Karl Kling. With RAC DJs, RAC takes its remix theory to the booth, altering and combining tracks on the fly, to create an engaging soundscape fed by crowd energy and live interaction.   RAC has done remixes for Phoenix, Bloc Party, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ra Ra Riot, and many more.<br /><br />

                The whole girl song thing started in one obliterated collision with the karaoke world, when Dan thought it would be funny to get up and sing "I Am Woman." Funny for some maybe, but not for Dan. It was then that he realized yes, he still was an embryo with a long, long way to go. He left the safety of the karaoke world and ventured out into the hardened streets of LA, where he found a couple of down and out backup guys, a full band of rocker renegades, mixed in some girl songs and some bad choreography, and from the afterbirth, the Dan Band was born. They've played all over the LA area, starting at Largo, and ending up at Avalon (formerly The Palace) and have kicked ass in some tv shows and films, including "Jimmy Kimmel Live", "The Late Late Show", "Last Call with Carson Daley", "Old School" and "Starsky & Hutch"<br /><br />

                "Bombay Bicycle Club is a melodic, guitar-driven indie rock outfit from North London, comprised of frontman Jack Steadman, guitarist Jamie MacColl, drummer Suren de Saram, and bassist Ed Nash. Steadman, MacColl, and Saram -- who at the time were all students at University College School (attending at the same time as members of Cajun Dance Party), and not one of them over the age of 15 -- formed the group in Crouch End in 2005, initially calling themselves "the Canals." They adopted different names over the course of the next year until Nash was brought on board in 2006, at which point the fledgling group dubbed itself Bombay Bicycle Club, in reference to an Indian restaurant chain. Bombay Bicycle Club entered Virgin Mobile's "Road to V" battle-of-the-bands contest soon after, a move that would effectively launch them out of obscurity and into the spotlight as one of that year's most hyped indie acts in Britain.<br><br>
Blending together sensual, reverb-slicked, post-punk sensibilities with the kind of quirky, rhythmically adventurous bubbliness that evoked acts like Orange Juice, Bloc Party, and Vampire Weekend, Bombay Bicycle Club ended up winning the competition -- which, in previous years, had been won by the likes of Young Knives -- and were given a spot opening up V Festival that August. A flurry of offers from several big labels came in, but Bombay Bicycle Club opted to self-release their first disc on their homegrown label, Mmm.... Produced by Jim Abiss (who'd previously worked with the Arctic Monkeys), Bombay Bicycle Club's debut EP, The Boy I Used to Be, was released in February 2007; the disc was given a warm critical reception, notably from the folks at NME. Another EP, How We Are, was released that October, debuting at the number two spot on the U.K. indie singles chart.<br><br>
The members of Bombay Bicycle Club graduated upper secondary school the following June, and the rest of their summer was dominated by the release of a new single, "Evening/Morning" (released on the Young and Lost Club label), and a flurry of U.K. tour dates. Teaming up once again with Abiss, they recorded their debut full-length at Konk Studios that fall. Bombay Bicycle Club signed with Island Records as the year came to a close; their debut full-length on that label, I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose, was released the following summer. In July of 2010, Bombay Bicycle Club released its sophomore effort, Flaws, which found the bandmates unplugging their instruments and recording acoustic songs including a cover of Joanna Newsom's "Swansea." In 2011, Bombay Bicycle Club returned to a fully electric sound with the release of the Abiss-produced A Different Kind of Fix. The plugged-in, pop/rock approach was evident on the atmospheric dance-oriented lead-off single, "Shuffle."" - Margaret Reges, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                It’s not easy to label the kind of music Plants and Animals make, but it’s easy for it to feel instantly familiar. Maybe that’s because they record to tape, and their records sound like they could have been made in 1972. But for all their analog warmth, it’s also impossible to deny how raw and recent the songs sound, and harder still to find anything else that sounds quite the same.
 
Anyone who took their debut, Parc Avenue, into their home and hearts probably already knows this. Since that album was released in early 2008 the band has played over 100 shows, circling the Western world more than once, including appearances at the Pitchfork Festival in Chicago, Primavera in Barcelona, Central Park Summer Stage with the National, and even one night in Columbus opening for Gnarls Barkley, after Danger Mouse discovered Parc Avenue and invited them out. But regardless of where it happened, anyone who has seen the three of them perform live knows that their big sound isn’t some kind of studio wizardry.

Plants and Animals are Warren C. Spicer, Matthew ‘the Woodman’ Woodley, and Nicolas Basque, the product of a musical three-way between two boyhood friends from Canada’s East Coast, and a French-Canadian. As their name suggests, the band has been a creature of evolution from the start. Its first incarnation was entirely instrumental, with loose song structures that built sound around themes and came out like epic folk music. By the time Parc Avenue was complete, Warren was singing and some of the songs were even under four minutes.<br /><br />

                Old Crow Medicine Show (OCMS) have come full circle playing their own brand of American roots music with a rock and roll attitude. The quintet met in New York in 1998 and hit the road, traveling city to city in a van and busking in the streets. They eventually settled for a year in North Carolina, where they ran into a bit of good fortune while playing in front of a local pharmacy to an impressed Doc Watson; the folk icon promptly scheduled the band to play at his MerleFest.<br><br>

Soon after, OCMS relocated to Nashville and found themselves gracing the stage of the Grand Ole Opry, opening for Dolly Parton, touring with Merle Haggard and regularly appearing on NPR's A Prairie Home Companion. They caught the attention of Nettwerk Records in 2003 and signed on to release their debut album O.C.M.S, which they recorded at RCA's legendary Studio B and Woodland Sound Studio with producer/guitarist David Rawlings (Gillian Welch, Robyn Hitchcock) at the helm. O.C.M.S was released in 2004 to critical acclaim; the New Yorker said of the album, "Heartbreaking, plunky ballads and unfastened fiddle tunes charged with youthful vigor," while the Village Voice predicted, "Fame will soon lift her skirt for the band."<br><br>

Their sophomore album, Big Iron World, was released in August 2006 and combined traditional American standards (including Woody Guthrie's "Union Maid") with OCMS originals that blended American roots, folk, blues, gospel, bluegrass and a little bit of gritty rock. Again produced by Rawlings, the album caught the attention of critics from Billboard to Vanity Fair and the first single, a cover of the Rolling Stones' "Down Home Girl," quickly became the #2 most added song at Triple A radio. Combined, the two albums have gone on to sell over 300,000 units.<br><br>

OCMS can attribute much of their success to their relentless touring schedule. Between headlining shows and countless festivals (Bonnaroo, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, New Orleans Jazz Festival, etc), the band is constantly on the road and thrives off of their fans and live shows. They have made a name for themselves as energetic performers with an unbridled spirit.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Many years ago, in a moment of professional crisis, I took up for a spell with The Jayhawks, an earnest band from Minnesota with whom I shared a tour, a dog-eared sensibility, and the lack of sufficient patronage that might’ve kept us from sleeping triple in the double beds of hard-lit motel rooms scattered throughout the land of the Great Lakes. Before meeting them, I had been given their most recent album by way of introduction; and I will confess here that upon first listen I became so seduced by the singular character that emerged from the songs, that I failed to register that there were actually two very different singers giving rise to him. Honest: I heard it all as if coming from one central figure who had a voice all his own, and that neither lead singer in the band could wholly claim or account for.<br><br>

I was embarrassed when this mishearing was initially pointed out to me; but had I been on the other end of that inadvertent deception I would have thrilled to it: the notion that a nameless Other might have been rendered so persuasively in song that the artists themselves disappeared fully into its arc and service.<br><br>

So now has proved the case with Kenneth Pattengale and Joey Ryan, The Milk Carton Kids: I listen and, try as I might, forget to hear them as distinct collaborators in song and story. Instead, they move to become a single, shadowy persona within the frame of Prologue –like young twins cast to tag-team one demanding role in a terse-but-tender film by Elia Kazan, haunted and hounded across a lonely landscape in search of the love that might provide their collective character a fleeting taste of both redemption and self-recognition.<br><br>

And it isn’t only their singing voices that build this hall of mirrors for me: their songwriting and string work wind around each other like coarse briar at the base of a flag pole, confusing the mind as to how exactly it is fixed to the ground, while clearly keeping its banner raised high above the thorns, streaming if frayed. It is a flag that flies on behalf of no clear territory, though, as much as it waves to commemorate some missed opportunity; as if a particular time itself had been the fool’s destination, fading immediately upon arrival…leaving sand in the shoe, love in the rearview, and a hand bereft of the hammer that had almost forged something (God save us) permanent.<br><br>

Their individual aspirations aside –Joey’s or Kenneth’s— I should say I don’t wish for it to be different, don’t wish for my confusions between them to be abated. I prefer disorientation when it comes to music. I live to be deceived, and would far rather be seduced than have anything explained.<br><br>

As for this unnamed fella, then, who weaves hurt-but-hopeful through these songs…he’s got something he needs to tell me, I think. And only because he speaks to me from the moving shadows, his face half hidden, will I truly be able to recognize his story as my own.<br><br>
- Joe Henry<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Many years ago, in a moment of professional crisis, I took up for a spell with The Jayhawks, an earnest band from Minnesota with whom I shared a tour, a dog-eared sensibility, and the lack of sufficient patronage that might’ve kept us from sleeping triple in the double beds of hard-lit motel rooms scattered throughout the land of the Great Lakes. Before meeting them, I had been given their most recent album by way of introduction; and I will confess here that upon first listen I became so seduced by the singular character that emerged from the songs, that I failed to register that there were actually two very different singers giving rise to him. Honest: I heard it all as if coming from one central figure who had a voice all his own, and that neither lead singer in the band could wholly claim or account for.<br><br>

I was embarrassed when this mishearing was initially pointed out to me; but had I been on the other end of that inadvertent deception I would have thrilled to it: the notion that a nameless Other might have been rendered so persuasively in song that the artists themselves disappeared fully into its arc and service.<br><br>

So now has proved the case with Kenneth Pattengale and Joey Ryan, The Milk Carton Kids: I listen and, try as I might, forget to hear them as distinct collaborators in song and story. Instead, they move to become a single, shadowy persona within the frame of Prologue –like young twins cast to tag-team one demanding role in a terse-but-tender film by Elia Kazan, haunted and hounded across a lonely landscape in search of the love that might provide their collective character a fleeting taste of both redemption and self-recognition.<br><br>

And it isn’t only their singing voices that build this hall of mirrors for me: their songwriting and string work wind around each other like coarse briar at the base of a flag pole, confusing the mind as to how exactly it is fixed to the ground, while clearly keeping its banner raised high above the thorns, streaming if frayed. It is a flag that flies on behalf of no clear territory, though, as much as it waves to commemorate some missed opportunity; as if a particular time itself had been the fool’s destination, fading immediately upon arrival…leaving sand in the shoe, love in the rearview, and a hand bereft of the hammer that had almost forged something (God save us) permanent.<br><br>

Their individual aspirations aside –Joey’s or Kenneth’s— I should say I don’t wish for it to be different, don’t wish for my confusions between them to be abated. I prefer disorientation when it comes to music. I live to be deceived, and would far rather be seduced than have anything explained.<br><br>

As for this unnamed fella, then, who weaves hurt-but-hopeful through these songs…he’s got something he needs to tell me, I think. And only because he speaks to me from the moving shadows, his face half hidden, will I truly be able to recognize his story as my own.<br><br>
- Joe Henry<br /><br />

                When Mark Van Doren, the American poet and teacher, wrote his famous work, "Our Lady Peace" in 1943, he couldn't have imagined the concept of rock'n'roll, let alone that a Canadian rock group would adopt his title for their name. Consisting of Raine Maida, Duncan Coutts, Jeremy Taggart and Steve Mazur, Our Lady Peace is one of the most successful bands in Canada today. The band has sold over 5 million albums worldwide, won four JUNO Awards and ten Much Music Video Awards - one of the most MMVA's ever awarded to any artist or group. In 2009 the band has released their seventh studio release, titled Burn Burn to critical accolades and has been certified Gold in Canada.  The band’s new album “Curve” debuted in the Top 10 of Canada’s national album sales chart.  Curve was recorded with co-producer Jason Lader (Lader’s impressive resume includes production work on Jay-Z’s “99 Problems,” along with Mars Volta, Julian Casablancas, Rilo Kiley, Elvis Costello and Noah & the Whale).<br /><br />

                Iconic New York-born, San Francisco-based rapper and producer, Aesop Rock, is joining forces with Rhymesayers to release his sixth studio album, Skelethon, on July 10th 2012. Since the release of None Shall Pass in 2007, we've seen Aesop Rock touring the world, launching online arts outlet, 900bats.com, and collaborating on LPs with Felt, Hail Mary Mallon, the Uncluded and more. Skelethon not only sees the rapper back waxing poetically on his own but also marks his first wholly self-produced effort. While the sounds are familiar, we see Aesop venturing in some exciting new directions with guest appearances from indie rock archetype, Kimya Dawson, as well as Allyson Baker of Dirty Ghosts, Hanni El Khatib, Nicky Fleming-Yaryan, Rob Sonic, DJ Big Wiz and the Grimace Federation. Aesop's new album follows in the wake of several deep personal losses and highlights subject matter that deals with the sometimes-futile ways people try to cope with serious issues. The cover art comes from Barcelona-based painter Aryz. Skelethon is set to be both a showpiece for his illustrious career and a serious payoff for his droves of ever-patient loyal fans.<br /><br />

                Since their inception in 1984, The Mighty Mighty BossToneS have been one of rock music’s most prolific touring and recording bands. During their 27 year career they have played thousands of shows all over the world and released a slew of ground breaking albums.<br><br>
The BossToneS formed when Cambridge, Massachusetts high school chums Joe Gittleman, Nate Albert and Ben Carr approached Dicky Barrett about fronting their new band. Barrett agreed and brought in his pals Tim Bridwell and Tim Burton on horns. They were joined by drummer Josh Dalsimer. In early 1984 the band played its first gigs in several clubs and barrooms around Boston. Barrett, Gittleman, Burton and Carr have remained constant members. The current line-up also includes drummer Joe Sirois, who replaced Dalsimer in 1991, Saxaphonist Kevin Lenear, an early member who left the band in 1998 and returned in 2008, and guitarist Lawrence Katz and trombonist Chris Rhodes, both of whom joined in 2000.<br><br>
The BossToneS are credited as a progenitor of the ska-punk genre, and the creators of its sub-genre ska-core, a form of music which mixes ska with punk and hardcore. Since the release of their 1989 debut album Devil’s Night Out, the band has toured and recorded extensively. They were a key figure in the development of the mid-90’s “Third Wave” ska scene and one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream with their platinum-selling 1997 album Let’s Face It, and its hit single “The Impression That I Get.” They have also earned the reputation as one of the hardest touring bands in rock. The band released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a hiatus in December 2003.<br><br>
In the fall of 2007 the BossToneS reunited to resume touring and recording, releasing their eighth studio album, Pin Points and Gin Joints, in December 2009. Their newest album, The Magic of Youth, was released on December 6, 2011.<br /><br />

                "My purpose for music is positive social change," says Orange County, California native Aloe Blacc. "Even if the music itself does not explicitly express anything that may signify positive social change, the product of the music will." He is speaking in general terms regarding his career, but more specifically about the circumstances surrounding his upcoming album, Good Things, co-written by the versatile vocalist and songwriter in conjunction with the in-house production team at Truth & Soul Records.<br><br>
Good Things marks a shift in methodology from personal to political for Aloe, who refers to the project as his report on present conditions—joblessness, homeless, the misappropriation of wealth, pillaging of resources, and a universal lack of compassion from the capitalism at-large under which we all function, but some struggle to survive. Song titles such as "You Make Me Smile" and "Miss Fortune," coupled with airy, ethereal production from Truth & Soul's Leon Michels and Jeff Silverman mask a foreboding undercurrent in which Aloe crafts lyrics both thoughtful and thought-provoking. Nowhere is this more evident than on lead single, "I Need a Dollar"—commissioned by HBO as the theme music for the series How to Make It in America—because ultimately, that is how to make it in America. <br><br>
The first-generation American offspring of Panamanian parents, Aloe has become what writer and activist Amiri Baraka (nee Leroi Jones) once said of John Coltrane. He is a singular "scope of feeling…a more fixed traveler" who has found cohesion in art and life. The path from his 2006 debut, the multi-genre Shine Through, to Good Things is akin to the maturation of Marvin Gaye between That's the Way Love Is and the What's Going On masterwork that followed. Aloe has never purported to be any heir to Gaye, but musically, Good Things and What's Going On are companion pieces as both albums establish a character for the artists that sets them apart from the sea of performers making very vivid and discernible—yet normative and conformist—statements about who they are and what they do. Good Things is a definitive declaration that places Aloe directly in the framework of modern soul.  <br><br>
At the heart of this musical character is a recession-age Robin Hood, whose goal is to sell and profit from his wares with hope of freeing the less fortunate from the capitalist system that serves as both their oppressor and his motivation. A 2001 graduate of the University of Southern California, Aloe credits a myriad of influences—transcendentalist scholars Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, French existentialism, Oprah Winfrey, Tavis Smiley, Cornel West—with leading him from the inner streams of consciousness he possessed as an MC early in his career, to a more disciplined approach to songwriting, and now, the desire to affect change and induce compassion by way of his own success. It is his grand scheme, which, not coincidentally, is also the name of his backing band (The Grand Scheme). The key is compromise and understanding the power of popular art. Aloe is willing to put the gloves on and engage in the marketplace. Good things lie ahead. – Ronnie Reese<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                Sub-Radio Standard originated with guitarists Matt Prodanovich and John Fengya messing around with covers and attempting original songs in Matt’s basement in 2005. By the end of 2008 however, with the addition of drummer, Michael Pereira, the band began to concentrate on producing original lyrics and melodies. After auditioning several singers without luck, the band finally found Adam Bradley. Still lacking a bassist, Mark Siford stepped in. The new dynamics of the group helped to jumpstart the band’s productivity and Sub-Radio Standard was officially born.  The band quickly began writing original songs as well as learning covers. Since 2009, they have successfully recorded an eight-song EP and have many more songs in the making. Sub-Radio Standard has performed at many venues including Jammin’
Java. They have also opened for nationally touring act Ian Axel, worked with a platinum winning producer, and have been featured several times on DC101, one of DC's largest radio stations. Recently, Sub-Radio Standard added Michael Chinen to strengthen up their rhythm section. The band is eager to share its music with even larger audiences and is actively looking to participate in more live shows.<br /><br />

                "New Jersey's hazy indie rockers Real Estate feature Titus Andronicus' Martin Courtney, Etienne Duguay (who also records as Predator Vision), Alex Bleeker, and Matthew Mondanile, also of Ducktails. The foursome had played together in bands -- including a Weezer cover band -- during high school, but didn't become Real Estate until Courtney returned to the Garden State after attending college in Olympia, Washington. After forming in summer 2008, the band began playing live that fall and released the Suburban Beverage 7", which introduced Real Estate's brand of surfy, lo-fi pop, early in 2009. A song on the Underwater Peoples Records Showcase and the Fake Blues EP appeared that summer; the band spent the fall touring with Girls before its self-titled debut was released by Woodsist. The quartet joined the Domino Records roster in 2011 for its sophomore album, Days, which hit the shelves that fall." - Heather Phares, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                "Marina and the Diamonds, really just Marina Diamandis, was born in Wales to Welsh and Greek parents in 1986, although she has often claimed to be from Ancient Greece. After dropping out of four different music courses at four different universities, Marina decided to make her own way in music, and began writing her own unique brand of left-field pop songs under her new stage name. Early on, she claimed that her inspirations were Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani -- who she often covered at live gigs -- but her songs have a soulful edge pointing to a deeper source of influence.<br><br>

Her piano/keyboard-driven songs vary from melancholic ballads to out-and-out glam-pop, but her unique voice and melodic style are omnipresent in her music. Essentially a solo artist, Marina wrote the bulk of her early material alone, arranging it for a band to ensure her live shows carried the full energy of her studio recordings. Quick to distance herself from comparisons to the rest of the female solo artists who broke through in 2009, Marina was also open about voicing her opinions on more established musical peers including Lily Allen and Kate Nash. In interviews she often showed a dislike of being grouped together with other emerging artists, especially when she had nothing in common with them except gender. The variety in her music made it hard to classify or pigeonhole, and comparisons were made with artists as diverse as Regina Spektor and Elvis Costello. The startling "cuckoo!" refrain of "Mowgli's Road" and the introspective balladry of "Obsessions" could not be more different, but it was the ever-present charm in Marina's music that brought her cult success in the early part of her career.<br><br>

Her first single, "Obsessions/Mowgli's Road" was issued by indie label Neon Gold in the U.S., also home to electro-indie Americans Passion Pit, and was followed later in 2009 by The Crown Jewels EP, which contained three new songs, including an electronic remix of fan favorite "I Am Not a Robot." After playing the exhausting British festival circuit in the summer of 2009, Marina briefly retired to the studio to polish off her debut album, 2010's The Family Jewels, before quickly hitting the road again. The group's second, full-length studio outing, Electra Heart, was preceded by the singles " Primadonna" and "Radioactive", the latter of which appeared only on the deluxe version of the album." - Jack Semmence, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                "Coming from Cape Town, South Africa, the hip-hop duo Die Antwoord struck Internet viral gold with their video hit "Enter the Ninja," but they're really conceptual artists Watkin Tudor Jones and Yolandi Visser presenting their "inner zef." Before assuming the roles of Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er for Die Antwoord, the two were involved with satirical projects like MaxNormal.TV -- who wore three-piece business suits and delivered motivational hip-hop -- and the Constructus Corporation: a hip-hop fantasy group based around a comic book called the Ziggurat. The idea for a more vulgar rave-rap group began in 2008, but it wasn’t until a year later that Die Antwoord -- which is Afrikaans for "The Answer" -- began playing live. Their stage show was outrageous with Yo-Landi baiting and flipping off the audience, while Ninja rapped and danced, wearing only his trademark Dark Side of the Moon boxer shorts. That same year they recorded their debut album $O$, and introduced "Zef," which fused hip-hop, electro, and rave music. A year later, the videos they created for the tracks "Zef Side" and "Enter the Ninja" became viral hits. The latter featured Leon Botha, an experimental South African artist and one of the world’s oldest survivors of the premature aging disease progeria, who appeared as the group’s DJ. "Enter the Ninja" cracked the British Top 40, and major label Interscope soon signed the group and released their 5 EP in July of 2010. That October, the label released a revised $O$. A world tour followed." - David Jeffries, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                Dirty Projectors have been a part of my life since I heard their first album, The Glad Fact. At the time, I knew nothing about Dave Longstreth or the album he’d recorded under his own name as a college freshman, The Graceful Fallen Mango – an album I’ve always wanted to call “a fine slice of New England soul music” (whether or not that’s really accurate). The Glad Fact inspired me to write my first and only record review, in which, with all the awkwardness befitting an inexperienced and overzealous writer, I proclaimed,<br><br>

“Dave Longstreth is making his own fucked-up version of American music.”<br><br>

It’s funny to think that I would go on to play in the DPz touring line up and have my keyboard playing make it on to the New Attitude EP – let alone become budz with the dude!<br><br>

When I first met Dave he mentioned that he’d read the review and asked what I meant by “fucked-up American music.” I found it hard to articulate any sensible reason why I’d used that description, but some deep, non-verbal part of me felt like bro, it’s really true.<br><br>

Now, four game-shifting, next-level DPz releases later, I’m hearing the newest album, Bitte Orca, for the first time and that awkward phrase is crawling back into my head.<br><br>

Staring at the album’s title and tracklisting, I feel a little shut-out. I can’t glean any concept or narrative from titles like “Cannibal Resource” or “Useful Chamber.” I start to realize that this album can’t be explained as reductively as Rise Above (“Damaged re-imagined”) or The Getty Address (“concept album about Don Henley with nods to modern R&B”). This is exciting.<br><br>

At first, I listen to this record hunting for a theme. I hear big riffs that make me think of classic rock, so I think, “Is this Led Zeppelin deconstructed?” I hear folk guitar picking and gorgeous strings, so I think, “Is this 60’s folk-pop re-imagined?” But, as is usually the case, my lame attempts at categorization fade away and soon all I can hear is Dirty Projectors.<br><br>

You can look at the DPz discography and divide it up by recording quality (lo-fi vs. poppin fresh), supposed influence (old 60s shit vs. new “urban” flavor), or instrumentation/cast of characters (lone wolf CT shaman vs. heavyweight “rock ensemble”). It’s easy to look at it like this; stops along the way, “artistic growth”, career arc – Bitte Orca jumps these rails and it’s awesome.<br><br>

Ultimately, I don’t hear Brian’s brutally excellent drumming or Dave and Amber’s riffs as “classic rock” signifiers. “Temecula Sunrise” is not the sound of Dad cracking open a brew in ’75. It’s not Physical Graffiti for 2K9; it’s 2K9’s Physical Graffiti. You feel me?<br><br>

Bitte Orca’s most exciting musical reference point is DPz themselves. A certain way of singing or playing guitar that was just a germ on The Graceful Fallen Mango and maybe really started standing out on Rise Above, is now a full-blown style and this album represents its ascendance.<br><br>

Dave found the handful of musicians (Brian, Amber and Angel) who are his worthy collaborators and incorporated them into DPz in a way that fundamentally changes the game.<br><br>

I hear Amber and Angel’s ill lead vocals (on “Stillness is the Move” and “Two Doves”) and not only do I hear two insanely talented and powerful women (the Serena and Blair of a better world) but also shades of Dave himself, as if my old conception of DPz had exploded and was now reborn through new avatars. What I hear in Bitte Orca is new life.<br><br>

It’s tempting to listen to Bitte Orca as a series of signifiers – re-arranged, deconstructed, POMO’d, whateva – but in the face of such living, breathing music this would seem overly morbid. If the guitars can recall classic rock or grunge, it’s not because they’re returning to those styles, but maybe because they represent the next loop on the eternal, golden chain.<br><br>

“Isn’t life under the sun such a crazy, crazy dream?”<br><br>

What will most people make of a phrase like that? New age nonsense? The lyrical MS-DOS of pop robots? Overly used phrases and overly played guitar tones can seem devoid of meaning until someone like DPz finds the kernel of excitement that hides but never fades away and lets it rise up like the ’93 Suns. There’s a gigantic difference between plumbing the depths of pop garbage for jokes and empty memories and looking for truth where we all forgot it existed. You know how people sometimes say, “It’s funny cuz it’s true”? Well, it is!<br><br>

I couldn’t explain what I meant about “fucked-up American music” six years ago and I’m not that interested in trying to explain it now. I just think it’s fitting to describe DPz with a phrase that’s been exploited by the worst of the worst and the corniest of the corniest, but has always had the potential to mean something rad:<br><br>

The label would go on to release the act's 2008 debut, If Children, as well as the 2009 follow-up Knot and 2010 EP My Neighbor/My Creator. By the time of their 2011 self-produced album, Civilian, which was also released by Merge, Wasner and Stack were producing the finest work of their career and firmly placed themselves near the top of the indie rock pile." - James Christopher Monger, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

The group was founded by Anton Newcombe, Matt Hollywood, Ricky Maymi, Patrick Straczek and Travis Threlkel in the early 1990s in San Francisco, California.  Their sound is heavily influenced by the psychedelic sounds of the 1960s, but also carries influences from shoegaze, jangle pop, garage rock, and lo-fi sonorities.<br /><br />

                This journey begins with that Montreal-based band of travelers, composed of Patrick Watson (vocals, piano, harmonium), Robbie Kuster (drums), Mishka Stein (bass), and Simon Angell (guitar). After touring the wild hillsides of Canada, Patrick Watson embarks on a whole new journey in 2006 with the release of Close to Paradise. Receiving national and international acclaim as well as collaborating and sharing the stage with various renowned artists along the ride, they're ready to gaze at the rest of the world.<br><br>
Having a penchant for surreal acoustic landscapes, both organic and electronic, the band releases in April of 2009 Wooden Arms. Through this new album, the band scrapbooks their new songs, narrating the journey of a tour which took them to all four corners of the globe.<br /><br />

                Bob Mould is an American singer-songwriter, producer, and DJ, currently living in San Francisco.  An original member of the influential 1980s punk band Hüsker Dü, he released several albums after the band separated, including Workbook, Body of Song, and Life and Times, as well as Sugar's legendary album Copper Blue.<br><br>
Mould recently signed to Merge Records and will release his first album for the label this fall. The new record, recorded with Mould's live band of drummer Jon Wurster (Superchunk) and bassist Jason Narducy (Telekinesis, ex-Verbow), is his first collection of all new studio material since 2009's Life And Times.<br><br>
Mould began a series of shows in which he'll commemorate the 20th anniversary of Copper Blue by playing the record in its entirety. The first of these shows took place at this year's Noise Pop Festival in San Francisco and will continue with a series of European dates this summer with more to be announced.<br /><br />

                After years of recording in relative seclusion in the hills of Los Angeles , Ariel Pink (the first non-Animal Collective member on the Paw Tracks roster) makes his official Paw Tracks debut with “The Doldrums”. Originally a handmade CD-R release a couple years back, “The Doldrums” by Ariel Pink’s Haunted Grafitti was discovered by the Animal Collective during one of their west coast tours and became an immediate favorite.<br><br>
Recording at home with only a guitar, keyboard, and 8-track (the drum sounds are all unbelievably created with his vocals), Ariel Pink blends Lite FM and warped lo-fi pop into something beautiful and confusing, yet highly addictive.<br /><br />

                After a 19 year break, the Feelies are back with Here Before an album of all new original material on Bar/None Records. The new album touches on different styles from the Feelies’ long history while adding new grooves and musical ideas to the mix. Electric and acoustic guitars melt together in archetypal Feelies fashion on songs like “Nobody Knows” and “Should be Gone. “ Elsewhere there are slabs of driving garage rock like “When You Know” and “Time Is Right” and the down-tempo ”Bluer Skies,” and harmonically rich “Later On.”<br><br>

Here Before was recorded at Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey produced by Feelies founders Glenn Mercer and Bill Million. Besides Glenn on rhythm/lead guitar and lead vocals, and Bill on guitar and vocals, the album features Feelies mainstays Brenda Sauter (bass, vocals), Stanley Demeski (drums), and Dave Weckerman (percussion).<br><br>

The Feelies proper re-emerged with a new rhythm section (the line-up they’ve had ever since and that appears on Here Before) in 1984 and recorded The Good Earth, co-produced by Million, Mercer and REM’s Peter Buck). The album was released 1986 on the Coyote label (run by Steve Fallon, owner of Hoboken, NJ’s Maxwells, and the group’s manager for a spell), followed by two further releases on Coyote through Twin/Tone/A&M: Only Life (1988) and Time For A Witness (1991). The band shared bills with Patti Smith, LouReed, REM and Bob Dylan during this period and toured nationally.<br><br>

In 1992 Bill Million left the music business, moving his family to Florida and effectively putting the band on what turned out to be a very long hiatus. Meanwhile, Glenn and Dave continued playing together in Wake Ooloo, Stanley was a founding member of the band Luna and Brenda played in a number of groups including her own Wild Carnations. Glenn Mercer put out his first solo album in 2007.<br><br>

In 2008, the Feelies re-united to open for long time admirers Sonic Youth at Battery Park and then resurrected their tradition of playing low key gigs around national holidays (many at their old home base, Maxwell’s) rather than doing lengthy tours. In 2009 Bar/None re-issued Crazy Rhythms and The Good Earth, this being the first band-sanctioned CD release of the former; both titles were also issued on heavyweight vinyl and with download cards for access to bonus tracks. A highlight of the All Tomorrows Parties festival in New York state that year was the Feelies playing Crazy Rhythms in its entirety for the very first time. They also introduced new songs written by Mercer and Million raising fans’ hopes for a new album eventually materializing.<br><br>

In 2010, using the basement studio in Mercer’s New Jersey home, Glenn and Bill resumed writing songs and working out arrangements for new Feelies songs in the midst of rehearsals for live shows in Boston, Philadelphia and D.C. with Bill commuting back and forth from Florida for this. By Fall that year, the band had worked up 13 songs. Basic tracks were cut at Water Music in October with the classic Feelies line-up of Mercer, Million, Demeski, Sauter and Weckerman; tracking dates were engineered by Sean Kelly who also helped out with overdubbing sessions in November and mixing in December. In addition to their main instruments Brenda played violin and sang backup vocals, Glenn contributed keyboards and Bill, Stan, Glenn and Dave all pitched in on percussion.<br><br>

Many of their fans probably didn’t think they would ever get a chance to see the Feelies perform again let alone have a new album in their hands. Here Before adds a solid fifth album to the Feelies discography. The album will be released digitally as well as on CD and vinyl with a download card.<br /><br />

                Ben Howard is a highly praised British singer-songwriter poised for breakthrough in the
United States. His impressive live shows have lead to sellout tours across the U.K. and
throughout Europe. Howard and his band, through relentless touring, have created a huge
word of mouth buzz. He has recently received plenty of love from the British press and
the influential BBC Radio1, and with upcoming features in NYLON and spins on KCRW,
his fortunes look set to continue across the pond. His debut album Every Kingdom
(Communion Records) reached #7 in the U.K. charts. This tour will serve as Howard's
first American headline visit to coincide with the U.S. release of the album on April 3.<br /><br />

                Over 20 years in the making, singer songwriter Glen Hansard will release his first ever solo album, Rhythm and Repose, on Anti- Records June 19. Best known for his work with The Frames, The Swell Season and in the feature film Once, for which he won an Academy Award, Rhythm and Repose is Hansard’s debut solo album and first album of new material since his 2009 release Strict Joy with The Swell Season. The album will be available for pre-sale at the Anti Store.<br><br>
In recent months Hansard has been seen in the documentary The Swell Season which has toured the film festival circuit this year, contributed two songs to the blockbuster soundtrack, The Hunger Games, and been active in the promotion of Once, The Musical which successfully opened on Broadway on March 18 to rave reviews, including the New York Times who explains, “what was always wonderful about ‘Once,’ its songs and its staging, has been magnified.” Hansard will support the new record on a U.S. tour. See reverse for details.<br><br>
Rhythm and Repose is a result of Hansard’s last year and a half of living in New York City. The album was recorded by Patrick Dillett (David Byrne, Arto Lindsay, Laurie Anderson) and produced by Thomas Bartlett (Doveman, The National, Antony and the Johnsons). The record features the musical talents of Brad Albetta (Martha Wainwright) on bass, Ray Rizzo on drums, Nico Muhly and Rob Moose on strings (Bon Iver, Y Music), David Mansfield on slide guitar (Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Tour), Javier Mas (Leonard Cohen touring band) and half of Bruce Springsteen’s current horn section. Assisting on vocals are Cristin Milioti (Once, The Musical), Sam Amidon, Marketa Irglova and Aida Shahghasemi (Marketa Irglova touring band).<br><br>
Hansard is celebrated as the principal songwriter and vocalist/guitarist for the Irish group The Frames, who have established themselves as one of the most influential bands in Ireland. Hansard garnered a reputation as not only an unparalleled front man, but also for his dedicated following and his grounded, real-life songs. Whether he’s busking the streets of Dublin, where he got his start, or at the Hollywood Bowl, Hansard is always earnest and in-the-moment.<br><br>
Hansard is also one half of the acclaimed duo The Swell Season. In 2007, he and Czech songstress Markéta Irglová took home the Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Falling Slowly” off the Once soundtrack. Hansard and Irglová continued the success of Once with the 2009 release Strict Joy under the namesake of The Swell Season.<br /><br />

                "Grizzly Bear began as a home recording project for Boston-bred experimentalist Edward Droste, the son of an elementary school teacher, who laid the groundwork for the band's otherworldly debut album on a small hand-held tape recorder while holed up for 15 months in his Greenpoint, Brooklyn, apartment. His homespun D.I.Y. effort took on new life with the help of multi-instrumentalist Christopher Bear, a Chicago native who had worked in a diverse range of musical projects ranging from laptop electronica to free jazz, who added additional instrumentation and vocals to Droste's stripped-down sonic blueprints.<br><br>
The resulting album, Horn of Plenty -- a pet project originally meant only for Droste's friends -- eventually circulated through New York's underground music scene, with its unique blend of acoustic instruments, layered vocals, and found sounds earning comparisons to alt-rock heavy-hitters such as Sigur Rós, Sufjan Stevens, and Animal Collective. Originally released to little fanfare in 2004, the album gained momentum thanks to copious touring, with Chris Taylor joining the band on reeds and electronics, and Daniel Rossen providing additional guitar and vocals. It was reissued in 2005 as a two-CD set featuring remixes by Dntel (of the Postal Service), Final Fantasy, Solex, and the Soft Pink Truth (aka Drew Daniel of Matmos). An album of Droste's early demo recordings, Sorry for the Delay, was released in 2006 as the band finished up recording Yellow House, their second proper full-length album. Warp signed the band that spring and released Yellow House that fall. A year later, the Friend EP, which featured cameos from Beirut, CSS, and Band of Horses arrived. For 2009's elaborate Veckatimest, the band collaborated with contemporary classical composer/conductor Nico Muhly, Beach House vocalist Victoria LeGrand, the Acme String Quartet and the Brooklyn Youth Choir." - Bret Love, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                Ed Sheeran is blessed -- he seems to know exactly where he is going, and exactly how to get there. Where countless others fail to make an impression amid today's information overload, Ed's music and talent cut straight through.<br><br>
He has a poise that is as welcome as it is unusual in someone so young. He's both utterly self-assured but still charmingly open. He has a confidence that's built not on being able to sing someone else's song quite nicely on a teatime TV show, but on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gigs where it's just him, his guitar, a loop pedal and a crowd.<br><br>
Above all Ed's got this voice with buckets of soul and these incredibly affecting songs that despite being played on acoustic guitar are far removed from the standard singer-songwriter fare. In fact, Ed's songs are as informed by Jay-Z as much as they are by Damien Rice. They talk about the city he loves and the people in it and of it. They talk about the people made by it, and those damaged by it. They are about love and loss, but are also joyful when you need them to be. He is a unique talent whose combination of skills is frankly quite startling.<br><br>
Ed grew up in Suffolk where he learnt to play an old guitar given to him by an uncle. Spurred on by a chance meeting with the aforementioned Rice when he was 11, Ed started writing songs. Aged 16, he moved to London -- into a flat above the T-Bird pub in Finsbury Park -- with only one thing on his mind: playing gigs, as many as he could and as often as he could.<br><br>
"I was playing every night," he says, "sometimes three times a night. I played every open mic night going. At first the crowds weren't interested, but I learnt how to make them interested!" A thousand audiences from acoustic shows to hip-hop nights, or, indeed, any other genre, will agree with that.<br><br>
One night Ed played a tiny bar in North London whose website listed every young promoter in town. That night Ed Myspaced them all and a few days later he had nearly a hundred new gigs lined up. A pattern began to emerge -- all day in the studio, all night playing gigs. From the early days Ed would sell CDs of his songs out of his backpack, putting cash in his pocket to get to the next gig, but also planting a flag in people's minds that here was music that was worth paying for. Not satisfied by CDs alone, fans have flocked to his website to pick up everything from hoodies to jewellery.<br><br>
When Ed was told by his then management that he would need to conform to succeed -- including dying his hair, and giving up his unique delivery -- Ed responded by writing the cult song, 'You Need Me, I Don't Need You'. Over the next year he released five EPs, each one totally different, each one totally him. There was a singer-songwriter one, a live from The Bedford one, one written with singer Amy Wadge. Each sold better than the last.<br><br>
In February last year, after two years of constant gigging and sofa surfing, Ed recorded a live version of 'You Need Me, I Don't Need You' for leading urban YouTube channel, SBTV. The clip got 100K hits in two days and is now approaching 1.5M views. A few days later, he wrote what would become his first major label release, 'The A Team': a story about a girl he met whilst working at a homeless shelter. The video for that has just surpassed 1M views.<br><br>
By the time Ed released the final EP -- 'No. 5 Collaborations' in January, which featured the who's who of UK hip hop and grime: Devlin, Wretch 32, Dot Rotten, P Money, JME and Wiley, the support was so strong it propelled Ed to Number 2 in the iTunes album chart after just 24 hours. The only artist selling more copies was Rihanna. When Elton John called his mobile to congratulate him, Ed realised quite how big things had got. Amid interest from numerous labels Ed shortly signed with Asylum -- part of Atlantic Records.<br><br>
"Collaborations was the peak of my independent career," Ed says. "Now I am beginning my signed career. You have to pass the barriers, go to the next level. Some independent people do it well, but some never progress far enough. Signing to a label is the smart thing to do if you have the right deal. And I have the right deal."<br><br>
So now there is the album, entitled '+'. "I'd like to say it's all about positivity," Ed laughs, "but really it's just a cool sign that I love. It is also one step on from all the independent releases I have done."<br><br>
Ed's album is out in September and features a host of very special songs. Small Bump is a true story, with the most heart-wrenching twist, about a friend and her baby. Lego House is a love song that imagines a world where you can, ("pick up the pieces and build a lego house, and if things go wrong we can knock it down!"). Wake Me Up was written while sat, really drunk, under a tree by Jamie Foxx's pool (that's another story). Grade 8 ("your body is my ball-point pen/ and your mind is my new best friend...") sees Ed as a worrier/warrior with bloodshot eyes, his heartstrings being twanged by a virtuoso guitarist. The truth is, there's not a bad song on it, precisely because Ed wouldn't dream of allowing there to be a bad song on it, he's that type of guy. As you will soon see.<br><br>
"I have slept on a different sofa every night for two and a half years so I can do this," Ed says. "But the sofa thing can get lonely. I'm ready for my own place now; I'm ready for the next level."<br><br>
I don't doubt it -- or Ed -- for a minute.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                When you’re an independent artist you’re always having to work within a budget you can control. After all, there’s no record company picking up the bills – you’re paying for it all yourself.<br><br>
For Brighton, UK born and bred yet very much the adopted Australian son singer songwriter Mike Rosenberg, being independent has proven to be the best road he could have taken. There was a time, back in the e...arly 2000s, when things looked very different. There was a five-piece band called Passenger and the big money label behind it and there was a critically acclaimed debut album, Wicked Man’s Rest, but when the members of that band chose to go their own separate ways in 2007, Rosenberg opted to stick with the Passenger moniker and trust in his music, his voice and his guitar to take him where it would. He took to the streets and discovered not only that the experience enormous fun, but it also proved empowering for the likeable musical troubadour.<br><br>
“The busking pays for everything really,” Mike admits. “It’s crazy. I’ve funded my last four records basically from busking, so it’s a godsend really. It’s an amazing thing to have stumbled upon because it is the dilemma for every musician – how do I put a hundred per cent of myself into my music, whilst keeping myself together? It’s not a new problem – it’s always been the case – but you find something like busking, which you can still do; while you’re making money you can play your songs and hopefully further your fan base – it’s ideal really. You don’t have to put forty hours of your time into flipping burgers or making coffee or whatever it is. I’ll always feel very, very lucky about that.<br><br>
“Honestly, the more I do it, the more I enjoy it. You know, it’s great that it’s getting bigger for me but busking actually turns into a real way of life. The structure of busking and just being on your own, enjoying the cities and travelling, I dunno, there’s such a lo-fi thing that goes along with it and such an honest and simple way of living for that period of time that I really, really miss actually when I’m not doing it, so I really look forward to getting back out on the street again.”<br><br>
Having obviously got a real taste for the busking and the travelling, he thought he’d check out sunnier climes, which is how, in October 2009, Mike first took himself over to Australia where he managed to support Lior and Sydneysiders Elana Stone and Brian Campeau, and then played One Movement, a major music industry-focus festival in Perth. Back in Sydney, he met a neighbour who just happened to be ARIA Award-winning singer songwriter Josh Pyke, and the initial idea that would become Flight Of The Crow formed in his mind.<br><br>
The album proved the perfect entre into the Australian music scene, not least because Flight Of The Crow saw him joined in the studio by the cream of Australian independent musical talent, including Lior, Kate Miller-Heidke, Boy & Bear and Katie Noonan. By the time Mike felt it was time to return to the UK to launch the album there, he was selling out 500-seater venues across Australia. Before he left however, it was time to record a new album.<br><br>
“It’s very different to Flight Of The Crow… actually all my records,” Mike explains. “Flight Of The Crow sounded like it was made in the 1960s, which was kind of what we were aiming for, but this one is a bigger production and a bit more modern sounding.”<br><br>
As always, there’s a certain element of the youthful Cat Stevens in the tenor of Mike’s voice that tells you the emotions that drive his songs aren’t very far beneath the surface. Recorded again in Sydney, for the new album, All The Little Lights, Mike was joined once again by a core Australian band that included Boy & Bear drummer Tim Hart, jazz bassist Cameron Undy, who also played on Flight Of The Crow, and keyboards player Stu Hunter, from Katie Noonan & The Captains. If there’s a theme to be drawn from the album it’s not just the usual stock-in-trade of the travelling troubadour – love – but the love of life itself.<br><br>
Meanwhile the Passenger fanbase has been building very nicely, and very much from the ground up, with the busking feeding into the club gigs – all very organic. “It’s such a funny and slow process, the way we do it. We haven’t got a label, we haven’t got the big muscle behind it – it really is meeting every fan personally and trying to convince them to sort of buy into it, which is quite a bizarre way of doing it. But I think what I’ve found is people have a real personal relationship to it because it’s not just something on the radio – I might be busking and we’ll have a chat or have a beer after a gig or whatever – I think that personal thing is so important in making people feel part of the project and then hopefully becoming fans ultimately.”<br><br>
Among the highlights of this past northern summer’s touring round the UK has been opening for one of UK pop music’s most influential figures, Jools Holland, as well as Ed Sheeran, who just had the #1 album in the UK, and Australian acts the John Butler Trio and Josh Pyke, with whom he co-headlined a UK tour.<br><br>
“It was great!” Mike admits, that ubiquitous smile on his face. “I did shows with the John Butler Trio over here and in Europe as well. It makes such a difference when you play to those kinds of crowds compared to the busking, which as I say is like playing to each person individually sometimes, it is amazing to then be on a bigger stage and reaching such a big audience in one go.”<br><br>
It’s been a remarkable journey for Rosenberg, a journey that has inspired some of the finest songwriting you’ll hear anywhere, whether on a street corner, a sweaty rock’n’roll room or a concert stage. Listening to him, whether on record or in performance, you can tell he’s having the time of his life, and it’s all there on his new album, All The Little Lights. And the most exciting this is you just know there’s plenty more to come.<br /><br />

                The recent reformation of THE AFGHAN WHIGS proves a simple story, really. It was not precipitated by financial urgency, a need to cash in on some recent cover smash, or a made-for-TV movie deal; instead, it's all about three musicians who want to hit the stage together again. While every band reunion carries its share of nostalgic currency, an Afghan Whigs concert tour in 2012 - neatly timed to hit 25 years after their first live show in 1987 - promises to be a most unpredictable and contemporary experience. Then again, those were always the Whigs' defining qualities, along with a reputation as one of rock's most cathartic, powerful concert outfits. "I'd been asked about a reunion so many times over the years, and I kept saying no," says GREG DULLI, Afghan Whigs' frontman and chief songwriter. "I finally had to ask myself, 'Well, why not?'"<br><br>
The actual impetus to regroup occurred in 2010 during Dulli's first-ever solo tour - a rare hiatus from his ongoing gig as leader of his acclaimed post-Whigs outfit, THE TWILIGHT SINGERS. He had asked Whigs bassist JOHN CURLEY to join him on stage at a couple shows, and then Curley stayed on for a few more; soon after, audiences found themselves treated to performances of beloved Whigs' classics like "Step Into The Light" (off the band's 1996 noir masterpiece Black Love) for the first time in well over a decade. "I had a great time playing with John, and just hanging out," says Dulli. "More and more Whigs songs were finding their way into the set list. I hadn't sang those songs for years, but they felt fresh and alive in ways I couldn't have predicted."<br><br>
Following a similar bonding experience with Whigs' guitarist RICK MCCOLLUM during a day off of the Twilight Singers' 2011 spring tour, the desire to bring the original trio back to the stage was now sown in Dulli's mind - and, simultaneously, with the other two primary members. "Greg's enthusiasm definitely rubbed off," says Curley, who currently owns and operates Ultrasuede Studio in the Whigs' hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. "I didn't need a whole lot of convincing, though, after the recent shows we'd played together. We all came to the conclusion that getting the Whigs back together would be a lot of fun, for no other reason than because we wanted to." In November 2011, the three convened for several days in New Orleans; after the first night of rehearsal, however, it was clear that old black magic remained strong as ever. "We could've played a show that night," Dulli notes.<br><br>
Formed in Cincinnati in 1986 by the core trio of Curley, Dulli, and McCollum, The Afghan Whigs began with an almost preternatural chemistry. The group's combination of sheer volume, audacious personality, gritty soul immediacy, and swinging musical chops proved auspiciously rare in that moment of American indie culture, propelling them to the top tier of Cincinnati's music scene almost immediately. Mining urgent desire and will power, the Whigs started to venture outside their Midwest confines on a series of shoestring tours, eventually catching the attention of a small, fledgling label out of Seattle called Sub Pop. Sub Pop signed the Whigs in 1989, releasing the band's debut album, Up In It, one year later. Up In It provided the first addition to Sub Pop's roster from outside the label's Pacific Northwest's stronghold - not just geographically, but sonically: while certainly kindred spirits with the burgeoning grunge scene, the Whigs positioned themselves early on as a band that wasn't going to jump on anyone's bandwagon.<br><br>
That outsider status didn't stop them from becoming a crucial cog in the '90s legendary alternative-rock juggernaut, however. Indeed, The Afghan Whigs won over fans town by town with their idiosyncratic fervor. In pre-Internet days, the Whigs got attention via a wily cocktail of hard graft and raw talent: hanging flyers in record stores, playing incessant shows, doing fanzine interviews, garnering college-radio airplay - but above all, connecting with a passionate cult of admirers who found something compelling in the band's dark psychosexual force. The 1992 release of their second full-length Sub Pop album, Congregation, however, provided the first real glimpse of the potential behind the Whigs' bleeding ambition. Songs like the swirling rocker "Conjure Me" and the sinister anthem "Turn on the Water" proved serious indie hits, their videos even garnering airplay on MTV; a cover of "The Temple" from Jesus Christ Superstar, meanwhile, underscored Dulli's winking messianic tendencies. Even more so, this evolution of the band demonstrated Dulli's undeniable growth into one of the most distinctive songwriters of his generation: "I'm gonna turn on you, before you turn on me" goes the double entendre powering the chorus of "Conjure Me," displaying the slithering wordplay and obsessions with power relationships, self-loathing, and self-love that grew into vivid trademarks of his anti-hero persona. The Uptown Avondale EP would follow that same year, belying a new, evocative direction for the band: Dulli's lifelong embrace of soul music crept even deeper into the Whigs' sound, evidenced by moody, haunting covers of R&B classics like Freda Payne's "Band of Gold," Al Green's "Beware," and "Come See About Me," the Holland/Dozier/Holland smash immortalized by The Supremes.<br><br>
The underground couldn't contain The Whigs' growing stature, however. In the wake of a contract with Elektra Records, the band released its first major-label effort, Gentlemen, in 1993. A deeply personal opus exploring the brutal rise and fall of a doomed love affair, Gentlemen would prove to be the band's critical breakthrough, appearing on numerous year-end "best of" lists. Rolling Stone praised Gentlemen as a "corrosive yet very soulful master-work"; elsewhere, famed critic Michael Azerrad called the album "a grow-on-you record populated by troubled characters, given life by Dulli's passionate vocals," while Trouser Press proclaimed it "an album that threatens to give pomposity a good name." Since its release, Gentlemen has grown to be considered one of the greatest albums of its era: SPIN placed it among its "Top 100 Albums from 1985-2005," while Alternative Press ranked it #14 on its "Greatest Albums of the '90s."<br><br>
The impact of Gentlemen opened many doors: alt-rock hits like "Debonair" and the title track spawned world tours and bigger venues, and increased MTV airplay and network television appearances ensued. More opportunities ultimately led to more temptations, however. Personal and professional pressures weighed heavily on Dulli in the wake of Gentlemen's triumph, and The Afghan Whigs' challenging next album, 1996's Black Love, mirrored these conflicts. Considered the band's supreme achievement by many hardcore Whigs fans, Black Love explored shadowy personal politics unflinchingly, made even more poignant by a strange, muted soul vibe throughout. There was certainly nothing quite like it anywhere then, nor since, which proved both a blessing and a curse. The lack of an obvious radio single meant that Elektra's attentions began to wander; this resulted in the Whigs leaving the label and commencing a long hiatus before resurfacing in 1998 on Columbia with its sixth album, 1965 - not coincidentally the year of Dulli's birth. Decidedly more upbeat, the songs on 1965 proved lighter and funkier, subversively packaging the now-patented sexual tension and inner turmoil that had drawn so many people to the band in the first place inside hooks and groove. "Afghan Whigs' leader Greg Dulli remains a black-music ironist bar none," Entertainment Weekly raved, giving the album an "A" grade. "Merging cool-fire post-grunge into Puff Daddy quotes and symphonic blaxploitation sweep, he creates maximum pre-millennium tension in 1965. Yet he's also one of rock's finest lyricists: His noir vignettes read like a Jim Thompson novel, their erotic narratives expertly skewering the male psyche..."<br><br>
1965 would prove to be the band's final album together, with Curley, Dulli, and McCollum parting ways amicably soon after the album's release. McCollum moved from Cincinnati to Minneapolis, where he continued to make music with his band MOONMAAN, among other projects; Curley stayed in Cincinnati to raise a family and operate his successful Ultrasuede recording studio, remaining a force in the local music scene. Dulli, meanwhile, quickly started his next musical project, the long-running collective known as The Twilight Singers, releasing its debut Twilight as Played by The Twilight Singers in 2000. By 2011, the Twilight Singers had released its fifth full-length album, the acclaimed Dynamite Steps; in 2008, Dulli also put out Saturnalia by The Gutter Twins, his successful, years-in-gestation collaboration with longtime associate Mark Lanegan.<br><br>
Despite these efforts, the Afghan Whigs story remained somewhat open ended. The core three members remained friends and stayed in touch, and in 2006 briefly reunited to record two new songs for Rhino Records' Afghan Whigs career retrospective Unbreakable. That action stoked renewed hope for further activity, which went unfounded until recently: in December 2011, the band announced that it would be appearing at All Tomorrow's Parties' renowned I'll Be Your Mirror festival on May 25-27, 2012 in London, England. As well, Dulli will serve as the curator, and the Whigs the headliner, for ATP's stateside edition on September 22nd, 2012 in Asbury Park, New Jersey; further dates continue to be announced, including major summer-festival headlining spots at Spain's Primavera, among others. Drummer Cully Symington (Okkervil River, Gutter Twins) and multi-instrumentalist Rick Nelson (Polyphonic Spree, Twilight Singers) will join Curley, Dulli, and McCollum for all shows, which will feature songs from the entire span of the Afghan Whigs repertoire, along with a few new surprises and songs never before played live.<br><br>
These developments provided both surprise and relief for the group's members. "The pressure is really nonexistent, because we're playing songs that we've already completed - that we already know," Dulli says. "Those songs still resonate with me; in fact, they have always resonated with me. I imagine there will be people who never saw the band before, too, and that's exciting." "It will be nice to experience the Whigs again as a grown-up," jokes Curley. "In my mind, the Whigs were a live band above anything else. Playing shows always was our favorite part about being in the band, and the times when we felt the most freedom and release. I missed playing at that level; I missed playing the songs that we wrote, that meant so much to people - and to us."<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                              
                “The detachment you can feel throughout our younger records is gone.  We felt like it was time to make a bigger, more generous statement."<br><br>
When describing the new album, Heaven, the Walkmen lead singer Hamilton Leithauser portrays a band hitting maturity, comfortable in its mastery, after a decade together.  Adds guitarist Paul Maroon, “when you’re starting out, you’re sitting there trying to come up with a big idea, but after a while, you learn about the process of writing. You learn about your friends in the band and how they work best.”
It's been ten years since the Walkmen made their debut album, Everybody Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone.   Ten years since they mixed the lovingly recorded analogue tapes down to the cheapest CD burner they could find. Ten years since lead singer Hamilton Leithauser snapped guitarist Paul Maroon’s arm in a celebratory wrestling match. Ten years since critics attached them to a New York scene they never wanted any part of.<br><br>
 But when Leithauser sings “We Can’t Be Beat,” on the opening track of their new album, he means it, like Cool Hand Luke getting up off the floor for one more round. “The world is ours,” he declares. This time, he may be right.
This spring, the band played a series of 10th anniversary shows that demonstrated how far they have outstripped their peers: two sets over two hours, no filler, rapturously received.  In contrast, fellow graduates from New York's celebrated rock revival class of ’02 have burned out or faded from view.<br><br>
The Walkmen are the great New York band of their generation, and in Heaven, they have delivered their third killer album in a row. Although Leithauser argues that “our biggest accomplishment is just being here,” they are making the best music of their career and filling their largest venues yet. Their spot at the top of the bill at May’s Crossing Brooklyn Ferry festival, curated by The National, demonstrates the respect in which they are held by the current wave of bands making music in the city.<br><br>
“In The New Year”, a standout track on their fourth record, You & Me, implies that at one point there was pressure to quit: “My friends and my family, they are asking of me, how long will you ramble, how long will you still repeat?” Lauded as a stunning collection of songs, beautifully arranged, the 2008 album revitalized their career.<br><br>
 Lisbon, released two years later, confirmed that trajectory, winning five star reviews for its short stories and spare, Sun Records sound. The clanging tones of Paul Maroon’s Rickenbacker Capri 360 and Gretsch Streamliner set the 1950s mood, as Leithauser channelled Orbison and Sinatra, in all their melancholy defiance.<br><br>
 On last year’s tours with Arcade Fire and Fleet Foxes, the Walkmen formed enduring friendships – and resolved to write a song that would make them headliners, once and for all. “There’s a kinship,” says multi-instrumentalist Pete Bauer. “You feel like someone else is out there taking music as seriously as you’re taking it. You realize that you’re a lifer.”
 So when Fleet Foxes producer Phil Ek approached them, asking if they’d like to make a record with him, they traveled to the studio he uses in the woods outside Seattle for the most intense recording sessions they had ever experienced. “He was relentless,” says Maroon. “And in the end, you can hear the difference.”<br><br>
 “We have never been on better behavior,” agrees Leithauser. “When Phil had an idea, we would be ‘OK, let’s try it.’ That’s not who we are! But we came up with a sound that we love.” Although the chime of Maroon’s guitar is unmistakable in the cascading arpeggios of “Song For Leigh” or the driving metallic riff of “Heartbreaker”, the setting is fuller, the production lush.<br><br>
 “There can be something brittle about our sound,” Maroon says. “He made it just a little bit warmer, a little bit stronger. When I play it in my car, it sounds strong, which I love.” On “We Can’t Be Beat”, Leithauser is Dion and his bandmates The Belmonts, singing pitch perfect doo-wop. On “No One Ever Sleeps”, Fleet Foxes vocalist Robin Pecknold plays Don Everly to Leithauser’s Phil, supplying a low harmony at once classic and contemporary.<br><br>
 “Love Is Luck” started out as an attempt to replicate the spacious, reverberating tone of Jamaica’s Studio One in the formative days of The Wailers. “Phil said ‘I hear this as a rock song,’” remembers Leithauser. “Then Matt came up with the drums and it started sounding like the Pixies: a big, loud, bombastic thing.”<br><br>
 The one song that the Walkmen insisted on, over Ek’s objections, turned out to be the track that pulled the record together and gave it a title. “Our children will always hear romantic tales of distant years,” sings Leithauser. “Don’t leave me, you’re my best friend. All of my life, you’ve always been.”<br><br>
 After 10 years, the Walkmen have everything that a great band needs. Leithauser is a mature singer of phenomenal stamina who can trade “The Rat’s” raw anger for the yearning of “Southern Heart” in a beat. Drummer Matt Barrick can pummel ferociously and drop down to Buddy Holly’s tramcar click. Bauer is a consummate sideman, effortlessly switching from guitar to farfisa to piano as required, or trading instruments with bass player Walter Martin, who has also written his most resonant lyrics yet.<br><br>
 All five members of the band have kids now and if the impact of parenthood is hard to pin down in a single lyric, there is definitely a new openness and emotional honesty to the songs.   Most importantly, the old gang mentality has deepened, becoming something worthwhile and lasting. “I’m very proud of what we’ve done. We’ve stayed friends and those friendships have grown,” says Bauer. “We have survival experience and real love that children generate in your life.” Heaven is a definitive statement of purpose and commitment, from a band at the peak of its powers that is finally winning the recognition it deserves.<br><br>

                Band member Adam Granduciel (born Adam Granofsky in Dover, Massachusetts) moved from Oakland, California to Philadelphia in 2003, where he met Kurt Vile and began playing music with him. They began playing as The War on Drugs in 2005, and self-released a demo EP. While Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group's career, before finally... settling on a lineup that added Charlie Hall as drummer/organist, Kyle Lloyd as drummer and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with The Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008.<br><br>
The lineup underwent several changes, and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd had all exited the group. Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi as the group slimmed to three members.

                Beach House is Alex Scally and Victoria Legrandand Bloom is the band's fourth full-length album. Like their previous releases (Beach House in 2006, Devotion in 2008, Teen Dream in 2010), it further develops their distinctive sound yet stands apart as a new piece of work.<br><br>
The landscape of Bloom was largely designed on the road, between the countless sound checks and myriad experiences during two years of tour. Throughout this period, melodies, chords, rhythms, words, and textures surfaced in moments of their own choosing. These spontaneous ideas were later gathered and developed in Baltimore, Maryland where the band lives and works.<br><br>
Bloom was then recorded in late 2011 over a period of seven weeks at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, TX and mixed for another two at Electric Lady in NYC. The band co-produced the record with Chris Coady.<br><br>
Bloom is meant to be experienced as an ALBUM. It offers a singular, unified vision of the world. "Many songs were omitted or dropped because they lacked a place within our vision for this album," notes Scally. Though not stripped down, the many layers of Bloom are uncomplicated and meticulously constructed to ensure that there is no waste. Each chord and melody performs its role to form a whole. The songs have depth and reveal themselves in new ways through repeated listening. As a complete work, Bloom transcends the banality of simple emotions and arrives at a realm of honesty and complexity. It soberly reveals how frightening and temporary, yet beautiful, our existence is. It creates an honest reflection of death, as it must to relate to life. To this Legrand adds, "Bloom is a journey. For me, it is about the irreplaceable power of imagination as it relates to the intense experience of living. A bloom is only temporary... a fleeting vision of life in all its intensity and color, beautiful even if only for a moment."<br /><br />

                Kimbra, NZ born songstress, is not a name synonymous with your average female singer, songwriter. Bringing a modern edge to the worn sounds of soul with a voice that belies her age, her jazz-influenced theatrical pop is inspired by a range of musical genres and artists, from Nina Simone to Bjork and Prince.<br><br>
After 3 years now based in Melbourne, Kimbra has completed her debut full length album, ‘...Vows’, set to be released in August. Featuring on the album are producers Francois Tetaz (Architecture in Helsinki, Gotye) and M-Phazes (Amerie, Pharoahe Monch). Her popular debut single and video for ‘Settle Down’ received rave reviews from around the world claiming her as the 'one to watch for 2011'. Kimbra also featured on Miami Horror’s track ‘I Look To You’ and has recently released second single off the soon-to-be-released album called, ‘Cameo Lover’.<br><br>
Kimbra’s whimsical soul pop invokes both past and modern soul luminaries, but matched with her own intrigue and quirk, a breath mint for the pop scene, and a knack for theatrics to show that being a bit “out there” is the name of her game. Make no mistake - Kimbra is picking up steam even as she arrives. It's going to be a wonderful trip.<br><br>
'Kimbra's got a pretty unique style going on right about now. The cut-and-paste vocals of Settle Down and the retro energy of Cameo Lover already belie something bigger than your average pop fare, complemented by a voice that swoops as low as it peaks. This is classic jazz intonation updated for the tech-age, all scats and doo-wops chopped and changed by some of the best knob-twiddlers in the business.'<br /><br />

                The Stepkids are three singer/songwriters. “A lot of what excites us about this band is this band itself,” says bassist and keyboardist Dan Edinberg. “It’s not either of us; it’s about creating an entity where the entity itself is what’s important.” As a result, every song on the Stepkids self-titled debut album is written with equal input from each member.<br><br>
“All three of us write and all three of us sing,” says Jeff Gitelman, who resigned from touring as Alicia Keys' guitarist to concentrate full-time on recording the Stepkids self-titled debut album. Drummer Tim Walsh continues, “There's an equal split in the creative process. Any lyric, any melody, any idea could have been done by any of us.”<br><br>
This approach comes from more than a decade of musical experimentation and experience.  Raised on the East Coast jazz and R&B circuit, individual band members went on to share stages with 50 Cent and Lauryn Hill, tour internationally with indie punk band Zox, score movies and commercials and produce solo albums.<br><br>
The Stepkids groove is a fusion of punk and jazz, West African and 1960s folk, neo and classic soul, classic funk and 20th century classical. The band produce, engineer and record themselves on a reel-to-reel.<br><br>
There’s no singular icon, no singular sound, and no singular way of making it happen for the Stepkids. It’s psychedelia for the 21st century, where the focus is on the whole.<br /><br />

                Here's how you know you've made it in the music business: You've stayed strong for three decades on your own terms, on your own time, by your own rules, and over that time your influence has only grown. Each of your albums has been stronger than your last. You've been brought onstage by Bruce Springsteen, because he wanted to play one of your songs. You've seen high times and low ones, good days and tragic days, but every night you give 100%, and every morning you wake up still swinging.<br><br>
This is the short version of the Social Distortion bio — the long version could be a 10-part mini-series. But over the past 30 years, the punk godfathers in the band have all but trademarked their sound, a brand of hard rockabilly/punk that's cut with the melodic, road-tested lyrics of frontman Mike Ness. Their searing guitars and a locomotive rhythm section sound as alive today as they did in '82, as do Ness' hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. "The most common thing I hear is, 'Man, your music got me through some hard times,'" Ness says. "And I just say, 'Me too.'"<br><br>
Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes (produced, for the first time, by Ness himself) is the band's first record since 2004, but the break hasn't changed them much. It maintains Social Distortion's key components — an all-but-perfected mix of punk, bluesy rock n’ roll and outlaw country — but it also finds them stretching the boundaries of their signature sound. "I didn't want any one style of writing," Ness says. "I didn't want it to be all heavy, like "White Light, White Heat, White Trash." I wanted some heavy and some light. I wanted some fiction and some nonfiction. I wanted versatility."<br><br>
That's evident right away. The record's first vocal track, "California (Hustle and Flow)," finds Ness and the band not roaring out of the gate so much as swaggering behind a chunky Stones-style locomotive groove. "This record has a lot of my influences," Ness says, "But how far you go with those influences is up to you. With this record I wanted to go a little farther. I wanted people to hear that second track and realize, 'Wow, this is not just another Social Distortion record.'" (For good measure the track has hints of "Ball and Chain" and the Stones' "All Down The Line" and, for the first time, female backing vocals. "I've been listening to records for years with (backing vocals), and I was like, "Hey, why don't I do that?" Ness laughs.)<br><br>
Not that the band's punk foundations have eroded; the first single "Machine Gun Blues," a piece of gangland fiction set in 1934, could hail from "Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell." But the record is evidence of the band's ability to evolve. "Bakersfield," a setlist staple in recent years, is a waking-on-the-railroad-tracks story of wrecked love, forgiveness and Buck Owens; it closes with a spoken-word verse to make Merle Haggard smile. "Can't Take It With You" sports a Jerry Lee-style piano solo that scorches paint. And set closer "Still Alive" is a soaring carpe diem with an added emotional weight that can't be described or duplicated.<br><br>
"The album is reminiscent to me of "Somewhere," but it also has some of the darkness that "White Light" had. It has some of the flavor of "Mommy's Little Monster," Ness said. "I think it's very signature. We've never been afraid to evolve and show people what we can do."<br><br>
Now in their fourth decade, Ness and Social Distortion have officially done one of the most non-punk things possible: They've failed to burn out.<br><br>
Mixing Springsteen’s factory-overalls ethic with Southern California punk energy and black leather, Social Distortion formed with Ness and high school buddy, the late Dennis Danell, in the late 1970s; the group broke in 1983 with the thrashing plate of punk and displeasure "Mommy's Little Monster." Their 1988 follow-up, "Prison Bound," hinted at a sonic change to come, and by the band's self-titled 1990 record and 1992's "Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell," their sound had solidified into the instantly recognizable brand of rock n’ roll that's defined them since.<br><br>
For Hard Times, Social Distortion consists of Ness and longtime guitarist Jonny Wickersham, along with bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr.<br><br>
These days the band is rarely off the road for long, and continues to grip fans who have been around since "Mommy's Little Monster" while drawing new ones who discover the band through hand-shot YouTube clips. "I see people bringing their kids to shows," Ness says. "And I see kids bringing their parents."<br><br>
Social Distortion is a mix of potent power, appeal across all age brackets and a genuine satisfaction at reaching as many people as they have. "I write songs for myself, and I hope that other people will like them too," Ness says. "I think every record you make is showing people what you've learned over the past few years. It's showing people, 'This is what I know.'"<br /><br />

                Somewhere in an old 1960’s apartment building in the city of Toronto, Canada, a well worn pair of cherry red cowboy boots wait by the door. About a half foot from those boots sits a guitar case, brightly decorated with glittery stars and images of Mexican painter, Frida Kahlo.<br><br>
A little down the hallway and towards the bedroom, a Johnny Cash record is spinning away. On the bed is a journal with a bird on the front cover and the saying “Go Slow, Life in Progress”.Sitting on the floor with a bottle of merlot and a red flower in her dark hair is where we find Lindi Ortega.It’s rather obvious from her appearance that Miss Ortega, with her ruby lips and Mexican/Irish background, is the kind of gal that would stand out in a crowd, but she prefers to be standing in front of one.<br><br>
Ortega released a four song EP in 2009 on Interscope/Cherrytree records called THE DRIFTER EP. It was met with critical acclaim. Toronto’s ‘Eye Weekly’ gave it a glowing four star review and called it “The perfect EP” and “A terrific teaser”. UR Chicago Magazine remarked that Lindi’s voice “undulates with absolute splendour”. In her time at Interscope Lindi was able to lend her vocals for the Diplo and Switch track “Good Enough”, also featuring Collie Buddz for the Major Lazer EP “Lazers Never Die” (2010).<br><br>
She’s no stranger to the stage, having toured across Canada and the United States, Ortega has performed for all kinds of audiences. She opened for the UK band Keane in North America, as well as a successful Midwest run with movie star Kevin Costner and his band The Modern West.Lindi has also applied her delicious vocals as a backup singer for Brandon Flowers (The Killers)since August 2010.<br><br>
Lindi Ortega has just completed a new full length record produced by Ron Lopata and released on Last Gang Records on June 7th of 2011. Lindi has already been proclaimed, “One of the most important new artists of the year,” (Tom Lanham, The SF Examiner).<br><br>
With her arresting vocals and unique brand of alt country, a genre she describes as “a roadside motel love affair between old school outlaws and country darlings”. The record will be a collection of songs that aims to speak to the desperado in all of us. Be sure to keep an ear out for that sweet vibrato and an eye out for those little red boots because it won’t be long before Canada boasts of a brand new country darling.<br /><br />

              <div class="copy">
                              
                Here's how you know you've made it in the music business: You've stayed strong for three decades on your own terms, on your own time, by your own rules, and over that time your influence has only grown. Each of your albums has been stronger than your last. You've been brought onstage by Bruce Springsteen, because he wanted to play one of your songs. You've seen high times and low ones, good days and tragic days, but every night you give 100%, and every morning you wake up still swinging.<br><br>
This is the short version of the Social Distortion bio — the long version could be a 10-part mini-series. But over the past 30 years, the punk godfathers in the band have all but trademarked their sound, a brand of hard rockabilly/punk that's cut with the melodic, road-tested lyrics of frontman Mike Ness. Their searing guitars and a locomotive rhythm section sound as alive today as they did in '82, as do Ness' hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. "The most common thing I hear is, 'Man, your music got me through some hard times,'" Ness says. "And I just say, 'Me too.'"<br><br>
Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes (produced, for the first time, by Ness himself) is the band's first record since 2004, but the break hasn't changed them much. It maintains Social Distortion's key components — an all-but-perfected mix of punk, bluesy rock n’ roll and outlaw country — but it also finds them stretching the boundaries of their signature sound. "I didn't want any one style of writing," Ness says. "I didn't want it to be all heavy, like "White Light, White Heat, White Trash." I wanted some heavy and some light. I wanted some fiction and some nonfiction. I wanted versatility."<br><br>
That's evident right away. The record's first vocal track, "California (Hustle and Flow)," finds Ness and the band not roaring out of the gate so much as swaggering behind a chunky Stones-style locomotive groove. "This record has a lot of my influences," Ness says, "But how far you go with those influences is up to you. With this record I wanted to go a little farther. I wanted people to hear that second track and realize, 'Wow, this is not just another Social Distortion record.'" (For good measure the track has hints of "Ball and Chain" and the Stones' "All Down The Line" and, for the first time, female backing vocals. "I've been listening to records for years with (backing vocals), and I was like, "Hey, why don't I do that?" Ness laughs.)<br><br>
Not that the band's punk foundations have eroded; the first single "Machine Gun Blues," a piece of gangland fiction set in 1934, could hail from "Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell." But the record is evidence of the band's ability to evolve. "Bakersfield," a setlist staple in recent years, is a waking-on-the-railroad-tracks story of wrecked love, forgiveness and Buck Owens; it closes with a spoken-word verse to make Merle Haggard smile. "Can't Take It With You" sports a Jerry Lee-style piano solo that scorches paint. And set closer "Still Alive" is a soaring carpe diem with an added emotional weight that can't be described or duplicated.<br><br>
"The album is reminiscent to me of "Somewhere," but it also has some of the darkness that "White Light" had. It has some of the flavor of "Mommy's Little Monster," Ness said. "I think it's very signature. We've never been afraid to evolve and show people what we can do."<br><br>
Now in their fourth decade, Ness and Social Distortion have officially done one of the most non-punk things possible: They've failed to burn out.<br><br>
Mixing Springsteen’s factory-overalls ethic with Southern California punk energy and black leather, Social Distortion formed with Ness and high school buddy, the late Dennis Danell, in the late 1970s; the group broke in 1983 with the thrashing plate of punk and displeasure "Mommy's Little Monster." Their 1988 follow-up, "Prison Bound," hinted at a sonic change to come, and by the band's self-titled 1990 record and 1992's "Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell," their sound had solidified into the instantly recognizable brand of rock n’ roll that's defined them since.<br><br>
For Hard Times, Social Distortion consists of Ness and longtime guitarist Jonny Wickersham, along with bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr.<br><br>
These days the band is rarely off the road for long, and continues to grip fans who have been around since "Mommy's Little Monster" while drawing new ones who discover the band through hand-shot YouTube clips. "I see people bringing their kids to shows," Ness says. "And I see kids bringing their parents."<br><br>
Social Distortion is a mix of potent power, appeal across all age brackets and a genuine satisfaction at reaching as many people as they have. "I write songs for myself, and I hope that other people will like them too," Ness says. "I think every record you make is showing people what you've learned over the past few years. It's showing people, 'This is what I know.'"<br /><br />

                After 20 years in the music biz, self-described “Little Folksinger” Ani DiFranco is still technically little, although her influence on fellow musicians, activists, and indie-minded people the world over has been huge. She still proudly identifies as a folksinger, too, but her understanding of that term has always been far more expansive than a bin at the record store or a category on iTunes, with... ample room for soul, funk, jazz, electronic music, spoken word, and a marching band or two. Over the course of more than 20 albums, including the live double CD Living in Clip (1997) and the two-disc career retrospective Canon (2007), as well as the latest one, ¿Which Side are You On? (2012), Ani has never stopped evolving, experimenting, testing the limits of what can be said and sung. Her lifelong tribe of co-conspirators includes everyone from Pete Seeger and the late Utah Phillips to a new generation of twentysomething singer-songwriters who grew up with her songs and shows — and then there's the motley crew of folks like Prince, Maceo Parker, Andrew Bird, Dr. John, Arto Lindsay, Bruce Springsteen, Chuck D, the Buffalo Philharmonic, Gillian Welch, Cyndi Lauper, and even Burmese activist and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, with whom she has crossed paths in a myriad of ways.<br><br>

Born in Buffalo, New York in 1970, Ani spent part of her twenties in New York City, then returned to her hometown where she established first a business office and then a performance venue called Babeville as the twentieth century ground to a halt and the twenty-first one revved up. For much of the last decade she's been based in New Orleans — but at her core she's always seen herself as “a traveler,” covering pretty much the four corners of the earth by now, both solo and with her band. (There's less corner-covering these days, now that she's consciously slowing down a bit and raising a daughter with partner and co-producer Mike Napolitano, but she still gets around just fine, playing venues like Madison Square Garden for Pete Seeger's ninetieth birthday bash and another star-studded lineup at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan for Wavy Gravy's seventy-fifth.)<br><br>


Early in her career, Ani made a choice that is now so obvious to so many people that it's hard to remember it was once considered brazen: to say no to every record label deal that came her way, and yes to being her own boss. That decision has earned her plenty of attention over the years, but it has never been what brought sold-out crowds to her shows around the world, fans debating every nuance of her lyrics, and fellow performers clamoring to work with her. No, all that has more to do with another choice she made early in life: To use her voice and her guitar as honestly and unflinchingly as she could, writing and playing songs that came straight from her own experience, her boundless imagination, her sharp wit, and her ever-more-nuanced understanding of how the world works. She did it in noisy bars with nothing but a shaved head and a lone guitar in 1990, and she's doing it with renewed intensity today.<br /><br />

                Pearl and the Beard is three voices, one cello, one guitar, one glockenspiel, one melodica, several drums, ninety-six teeth, and one soul.<br><br>
Former strangers Jocelyn Mackenzie, Emily Hope Price, and Jeremy Styles were united in the great city of New York. Each had migrated there from a far corner of the nation with naught but food in their pockets and money in their bellies. Each had the same true ...love. Since then the three have nested, and their unique brand of brightly melodic songcraft continues to blossom of its own accord.<br><br>
Pearl and the Beard loves you the way you've always been.<br /><br />

                Since the release of their critically acclaimed 2007 debut All Hour Cymbals, Yeasayer has been around the world and back again. While their first record was conceived in total artistic isolation, constant touring forced Yeasayer to finally engage with their contemporaries.<br><br>
Inspired by musicians hell-bent on sonic experimentation as well as those more comfortable in a pop context, Yeasayer find their domain spanning across the musical spectrum. Studied, road worn, and eager to begin phase two, Yeasayer retreated to upstate New York to begin work on their new album titled ODD BLOOD.<br><br>
If All Hour Cymbals was Yeasayer’s attempt at global and ambient cultural mash-up then ODD BLOOD takes place in an off-world colony sometime after the Singularity. Glimmering reverb haze is eschewed and replaced by a cavalcade of disorienting pitch effects and flickering ectoplasmic wisps. Instead of layered vocal harmonies the processed vocals congeal into blots and blobs of otherworldly chatter. Many organic elements are left behind and replaced by sounds and rhythms that inspire the body as much as the mind. At times Yeasayer sound as if they would be at home playing live in scene from Blade Runner or inside one of Oscar Neimeyer’s concrete modernist temples from the 1960s.<br><br>
ODD BLOOD is an album divided into two halves; the first being top heavy with pop songs, while the latter full of the playful and strange.<br><br>
Side One. The album begins with “The Children,” a twisted chopped and screwed stomp, full of sub bass and spooky keyboards. Distorted vocals create hidden hooks and it’s immediately clear: this isn’t the same Yeasayer. After the rubble clears the album leaps into Yeasayer’s version of the pop anthem with “Ambling Alp,” “Madder Red,” “I Remember,” and “O.N.E.” Yeasayer have plunged into the craft of pop music, and the exercise has paid off.<br><br>
Side Two. The second half of ODD BLOOD is slightly more experimental in nature. Sci-fi musical jams (“Mondegreen”), maniacal rants (“Grizelda”), and paranoia (“Love Me Girl”) show the band exploring more paranoid motifs, yet never deprive the listener of hooks and ear candy.<br><br>
ODD BLOOD plays out at a blistering pace, yet it never sacrifices depth or content. It is immediately evident the band has advanced in songwriting as well as sonic craft. Lyrically, it is a more mature and honest album than the first, as the band demonstrates a confidence to explore more personal themes alongside vividly depicted tales. One thing is certain: Yeasayer are accomplished audiologists who are willing to pilfer decades of pop sensibilities and cultural history to create something that is uniquely their own.<br /><br />

                "Equally influenced by diverse artists like Devo, Talking Heads, Scratch Orchestra, Raymond Scott, and Conlon Nancarrow, electronic music composer Dan Deacon studied electro-acoustic and computer music composition at Purchase College in New York. While he was a student, he issued his first recordings in small runs on CD-R, including Green Cobra Is Awesome vs. the Sun, Silly Hat vs. Egale Hat (yes, "Egale"), and Meetle Mice, all released in 2003. He later moved to Baltimore, MD, and became an instant figurehead of the city's fledgling electronic music community, joining the Wham City collective and evangelizing his and his fellow whimsical peers' "future shock" output. Linking up with the Carpark label, he released Spiderman of the Rings (2007) and Bromst (2009), two albums filled with hyperactive and often challenging electronic detritus." - Rob Theakston, AllMusicGuide<br /><br />

                I've been recording and performing as Height since 1998. I added the 'with friends' in 2008 and made it more of a band, and less like a rapper with an anonymous crew. The cast is constantly revolving. At the moment, we are performing as a five-piece band with live instruments.<br><br>
We've released thirteen albums and EP's. Wham City, Friends, Grand Man, Dogg Pony, Aural States and Snowghost Records have all put out our music.<br><br>
We've played over 500 shows in the US, Canada and Europe. We have toured with Future Islands, Dan Deacon, Beach House, Jana Hunter, Grand Buffet, Adventure, Cex, The Death Set, and Oxes as well as many equally good, but yet lesser known acts.<br><br>
We tend to keep all the writing and production in-house, but we've also been fortunate to collaborate with artists like Tobacco and Wye Oak.<br><br>
The music of Height has changed drastically over the years, and it will continue to evolve. The goal is always to make understated, moving music from the heart. We are currently putting the finishing touches on a new full length, due out this summer.<br /><br />

                With THE RAINWATER LP, Citizen Cope offers the clearest distillation yet of his distinct musical approach, a laidback gumbo of acoustic blues, singer/songwriter rock ‘n’ roll and deep soul grooves.  Born Clarence Greenwood, but known to friends and fans as simply “Cope,” the Brooklyn-based artist has crafted an album redolent of such classic tunesmiths as Randy Newman and Stevie Wonder – both major touchstones for his emotively penned songs.  As such, it’s virtually impossible to put a finger on Citizen Cope’s idiosyncratically inimitable sound.<br><br>

“The only way to explain my music is to say you gotta listen to it,” Greenwood says.  “I don’t think there is any easy description of it.  Somebody once said something about ‘urban folk,’ which I wasn’t mad at.”<br><br>

THE RAINWATER LP comes nearly four years after Citizen Cope’s acclaimed 2006 third album, EVERY WAKING MOMENT.  Not that Greenwood wasn’t busy – the hard-touring troubadour spent much of that time on the road, introducing fans new and old to his already substantial body of work.<br><br>

“It was longer than I’d expected between records,” he says, “but it was like a culmination of all the records getting into peoples’ psyche.  I just kept on touring, doing songs from all three records, and then I started getting ideas for songs.  I got inspired to make another album and put it out myself.”<br><br>

Since making his official debut, Cope had released three fine albums on three different labels, an experience which proved frustrating, to say the very least.  Having been through the industry mill, this time Greenwood was determined to take the bull by the horns and release the album himself.<br><br>

“A lot of labels wanted to put it out,” he explains, “but I kept hearing things like ‘Retail’s gonna need you to do this’ or ‘The artwork has to be like this.’  I don’t want to be led into those confines anymore.  I want to be able to do it my own way.  Being able to operate efficiently, not having to move buildings to do anything, just seems so basic for any artistic endeavor.”<br><br>

Like the music therein, THE RAINWATER LP – as well as Citizen Cope’s new RainWater Recordings, Inc. – takes its name from a number of deeply personal sources.  “It’s pure,” Greenwood says.  “It’s also the name of someone that was close to me when I was growing up, so it just made sense.”<br /><br />

                With THE RAINWATER LP, Citizen Cope offers the clearest distillation yet of his distinct musical approach, a laidback gumbo of acoustic blues, singer/songwriter rock ‘n’ roll and deep soul grooves.  Born Clarence Greenwood, but known to friends and fans as simply “Cope,” the Brooklyn-based artist has crafted an album redolent of such classic tunesmiths as Randy Newman and Stevie Wonder – both major touchstones for his emotively penned songs.  As such, it’s virtually impossible to put a finger on Citizen Cope’s idiosyncratically inimitable sound.<br><br>

“The only way to explain my music is to say you gotta listen to it,” Greenwood says.  “I don’t think there is any easy description of it.  Somebody once said something about ‘urban folk,’ which I wasn’t mad at.”<br><br>

THE RAINWATER LP comes nearly four years after Citizen Cope’s acclaimed 2006 third album, EVERY WAKING MOMENT.  Not that Greenwood wasn’t busy – the hard-touring troubadour spent much of that time on the road, introducing fans new and old to his already substantial body of work.<br><br>

“It was longer than I’d expected between records,” he says, “but it was like a culmination of all the records getting into peoples’ psyche.  I just kept on touring, doing songs from all three records, and then I started getting ideas for songs.  I got inspired to make another album and put it out myself.”<br><br>

Since making his official debut, Cope had released three fine albums on three different labels, an experience which proved frustrating, to say the very least.  Having been through the industry mill, this time Greenwood was determined to take the bull by the horns and release the album himself.<br><br>

“A lot of labels wanted to put it out,” he explains, “but I kept hearing things like ‘Retail’s gonna need you to do this’ or ‘The artwork has to be like this.’  I don’t want to be led into those confines anymore.  I want to be able to do it my own way.  Being able to operate efficiently, not having to move buildings to do anything, just seems so basic for any artistic endeavor.”<br><br>

Like the music therein, THE RAINWATER LP – as well as Citizen Cope’s new RainWater Recordings, Inc. – takes its name from a number of deeply personal sources.  “It’s pure,” Greenwood says.  “It’s also the name of someone that was close to me when I was growing up, so it just made sense.”<br /><br />
